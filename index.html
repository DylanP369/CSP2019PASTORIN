      <p><center>According to all known laws
      of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"YOU LIKE JAZZ?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

  
But don't kill no more bugs!

  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The bees!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more bee beards!

  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our yogurt night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
Bees have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Bees must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?

  
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

  
You boys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase number 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using laser beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You mean like this?

  
Bears kill bees!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little bee!

  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing bees!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the bees

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke.

  
Right. Bees don't smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story about...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a bee smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what nature intended for us?

  
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
Free the bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
The court finds in favor of the bees!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could do it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You know what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
Barry, how much honey is out there?

  
All right. One at a time.

  
Barry, who are you wearing?

  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

  
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

  
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

  
every last drop.

  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

  
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

  
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

  
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Oan't breathe.

  
Bring it in, boys!

  
Hold it right there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

  
Shut down honey production!

  
Stop making honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What do we do now?

  
Oannonball!

  
We're shutting honey production!

  
Mission abort.

  
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

  
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's going on? Where is everybody?

  
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

  
At least we got our honey back.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I thought their lives would be better!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the half of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't look very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose fault do you think that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

  
Bees?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

  
That's our whole SAT test right there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's no more pollination,

  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

  
I know this is also partly my fault.

  
How about a suicide pact?

  
How do we do it?

  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

  
I had to open my mouth and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

  
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

  
I know. Me neither.

  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

  
Roses!

  
Vanessa!

  
Roses?!

  
Barry?

  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, bees, pollen!

  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

  
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

  
Oould you slow down?

  
Barry!

  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it kind of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

  
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

  
- Bees.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

  
Security will be tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

  
Official floral business. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

  
Thank you. It was a gift.

  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

  
How about The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

  
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

  
Let's see what this baby'll do.

  
Hey, what are you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

  
Would you remove your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

  
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

  
I think this is gonna work.

  
It's got to work.

  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

  
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

  
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

  
Be careful.

  
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

  
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

  
Bee!

  
Don't freak out! My entire species...

  
What are you doing?

  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, Barry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

  
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

  
And please hurry!

  
What happened here?

  
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

  
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

  
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

  
No one's flying the plane!

  
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

  
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

  
Where's the pilot?

  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

  
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

  
As a matter of fact, there is.

  
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

  
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

  
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

  
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

  
I can't fly a plane.

  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

  
How hard could it be?

  
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

  
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

  
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

  
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

  
That's Barry!

  
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

  
and an incapacitated flight crew.

  
Flowers?!

  
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

  
with absolutely no flight experience.

  
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

  
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

  
They've done enough damage.

  
But isn't he your only hope?

  
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

  
Their wings are too small...

  
Haven't we heard this a million times?

  
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

  
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

  
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

  
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

  
But let me tell you about a small job.

  
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

  
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

  
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

  
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

  
We get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

  
Left, right, down, hover.

  
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

  
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

  
Barry, what happened?!

  
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

  
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

  
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

  
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

  
Move out!

  
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

  
Don't have to yell.

  
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

  
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

  
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

  
I can't do this!

  
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

  
You snap out of it.

  
You snap out of it.

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

  
How is the plane flying?

  
I don't know.

  
Hello?

  
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

  
The Pollen Jocks!

  
They do get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

  
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

  
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

  
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

  
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

  
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

  
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

  
Bring the nose down.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

  
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

  
Affirmative!

  
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

  
Land on that flower!

  
Ready? Full reverse!

  
Spin it around!

  
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

  
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

  
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

  
made of millions of bees!

  
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

  
Rotate around it.

  
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

  
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

  
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

  
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

  
Aim for the center!

  
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

  
Oome on, already.

  
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

  
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

  
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

  
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

  
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

  
Listen, everyone!

  
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

  
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

  
That means this is our last chance.

  
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

  
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

  
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

  
We're bees!

  
Keychain!

  
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

  
Hold on, Barry. Here.

  
You've earned this.

  
Yeah!

  
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

  
Oh, yeah.

  
That's our Barry.

  
Mom! The bees are back!

  
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

  
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

  
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

  
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

  
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

  
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

  
I had no idea.

  
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

  
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

  
Sorry I'm late.

  
He's a lawyer too?

  
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

  
Have a great afternoon!

  
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

  
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

  
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

  
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

  
Thank you, Barry!

  
That bee is living my life!

  
Let it go, Kenny.

  
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

  
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

  
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

  
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

  
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

  
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

  
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

  
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

  
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

<p><center>Good night, sweetheart.



 

                   

Good night, Mom.



 

                   

Sleep tight, kiddo.



 

                   

Whoa!



 

                   

Oh! Aye! Oh! Oh!



 

                   

Simulation terminated.



 

                   

Simulation terminated.



 

                   

Simulation terminated.

Simulation terminated.



 

                   

Simulation terminated.



  

                   

All right,

Mr. Bile, is it?



  

                   

Uh... my friends

call me Phlegm.



  

                   

Uh-huh.



  

                   

Mr. Bile, can you tell me

what you did wrong?



  

                   

I fell down?



  

                   

No, no, before that.



  

                   

Can anyone tell me

Mr. Bile's big mistake?



  

                   

Anyone?



  

                   

Let's take a look

at the tape.



  

                   

Here we go.



  

                   

Uh, right...

puh-puh-puh-puh...



  

                   

Ah! There, see?



  

                   

The door.

You left it wide open.



  

                   

And leaving the door open

is the worst mistake



  

                   

any employee can make

because...?



  

                   

Um... it could let in a draft?



  

                   

It could let in



  

                   

a child!



  

                   

Oh! Mr. Waternoose!



  

                   

There is nothing more toxic

or deadly than a human child.



  

                   

A single touch could kill you!



  

                   

Leave a door open



  

                   

and a child could walk

right into this factory!



  

                   

Right into the monster world!



  

                   

I won't go in a kid's room!



  

                   

You can't make me!



  

                   

You're going in there

because we need this.



  

                   

Our city is counting on you



  

                   

to collect

those children's screams.



  

                   

Without scream,

we have no power.



  

                   

Yes, it's dangerous work



  

                   

and that's why I need

you to be at your best.



  

                   

I need scarers who are

confident, tenacious



  

                   

tough, intimidating.



  

                   

I need scarers like... like...

James P. Sullivan.



  

                   

Hey! Good morning,

Monstropolis.



  

                   

It's now five after

the hour of  :   A.M.



  

                   

In the big monster city.



  

                   

Temperature's

a balmy    degrees...



  

                   

which is good news

for you reptiles...



  

                   

and it looks like

it's going to be a perfect day



  

                   

to maybe, hey,

just lie in bed, sleep in



  

                   

or simply... work out that flab

that's hanging over the bed!



  

                   

Get up, Sulley!



  

                   

I don't believe I ordered

a wake-up call, Mikey.



  

                   

Hey! Less talk, more pain,

marshmallow boy!



  

                   

Feel the burn!



  

                   

You call yourself a monster?



  

                   

Scary feet, scary feet,

scary feet!



  

                   

Oop! The kid's awake!



  

                   

Okay, scary feet, scary feet,

scary feet, scary feet...



  

                   

kid's asleep!



  

                   

Twins! In a bunk bed!



  

                   

Ooh! I thought I had you there.



  

                   

Okay, Sulley, here we go.



  

                   

You ready? Follow it.



  

                   

Oh! It's over here!



  

                   

Oh, look over there!



  

                   

Don't let the kid touch you!



  

                   

Don't let it touch you!



  

                   

I don't know,

but it's been said



  

                   

I love scaring kids in bed!



  

                   

Come on, fight that plaque!

Fight that plaque!



  

                   

Scary monsters

don't have plaque!



  

                   

   ... do you have    ?



  

                   

Do I see    ?



  

                   

Oh, I don't believe it!



  

                   

I'm not even

breaking a sweat.



  

                   

Not you!



  

                   

Look! The new commercial's on!



  

                   

The future is bright

at Monsters, Incorporated.



  

                   

I'm in this one!

I'm in this one!



  

                   

We're part of your life.



  

                   

We power your car.



  

                   

We warm your home.



  

                   

We light your city.



  

                   

I'm Monsters, Incorporated.



  

                   

Hey, look! Betty!



  

                   

Carefully matching every child

to their ideal monster...



  

                   

to produce superior scream



  

                   

refined into clean,

dependable energy.



  

                   

Every time you turn something on



  

                   

Monsters, Incorporated,

is there.



  

                   

I'm Monsters, Incorporated!



  

                   

We know the challenge...



  

                   

the window of innocence

is shrinking.



  

                   

Human kids are harder to scare.



  

                   

Of course, M.I. Is prepared

for the future



  

                   

with the top scarers...



  

                   

the best refineries



   

                   

and research

into new energy techniques.



   

                   

Okay, here I come.



   

                   

We're working for

a better tomorrow... today!



   

                   

We're Monsters, Incorporated!



   

                   

We're M. I...

Monsters, Incorporated.



   

                   

We scare because we care.



   

                   

I can't believe it.



   

                   

Oh, Mike...



   

                   

I was on TV!



   

                   

Did you see me? I'm a natural!



   

                   

Hello.



   

                   

I know!



   

                   

Hey, wasn't I great?



   

                   

Did the whole family see it?



   

                   

It's your mom.



   

                   

What can I say?

The camera loves me.



   

                   

I'm telling you, big daddy



   

                   

you're going to be seeing this

face on TV a lot more often.



   

                   

Yeah? Like, on

Monstropolis's Most Wanted?



   

                   

You've been jealous

of my good looks



   

                   

since the fourth grade, pal.



   

                   

Have a good day, sweetie.



   

                   

You, too, hon.



   

                   

Whoo!

Okay, Sulley, hop on in.



   

                   

Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.



   

                   

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!



   

                   

Where you going?

What are you doing?



   

                   

Mikey, there's a scream

shortage. We're walking.



   

                   

- Walking?!

- Yep.



   

                   

No, no, no, my baby.



   

                   

Come on. Come on.



   

                   

Look, she needs to be driven.



   

                   

Bye, baby.

I... I'll call you!



   

                   

Hey, genius,

you want to know why



   

                   

I bought the car? Huh?



   

                   

Not really.



   

                   

To drive it!



   

                   

You know, like, on the street?



   

                   

With the honk-honk

and the vroom-vroom



   

                   

and no walking involved.



   

                   

Give it a rest,

will you, butterball?



   

                   

Come on, you could

use the exercise.



   

                   

I could use the exercise?!



   

                   

Look at you.

You have your own climate!



   

                   

How many tentacles

jump the rope?



   

                   

Morning, Mike!

Morning, Sulley!



   

                   

Hey! Morning, kids.



   

                   

Hey, kids.



   

                   

How you doing?



   

                   

Bye, Mike! Bye, Sulley!



   

                   

Ow! Hey!



   

                   

Ah, nuts.



   

                   

Hey, hey, hey! Fellas!



   

                   

Hey, Tony!



   

                   

Tony! Ba-da-bing!



   

                   

- Tony!

- Hey, Tony!



   

                   

Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow!



   

                   

I hear somebody's close

to breaking



   

                   

the all-time scare record.



   

                   

Ah, just trying

to make sure



   

                   

there's enough scream

to go around.



   

                   

Hey! On the house!



   

                   

- Hey, thanks!

- Grazie!



   

                   

Ba-da-bing!



   

                   

Oh, great.



   

                   

Hey, Ted!



   

                   

Good morning!



   

                   

See that, Mikey?



   

                   

Ted's walking to work.



   

                   

Big deal.



   

                   

Guy takes five steps

and he's there.

Morning, Sulley.



   

                   

Morning, Ricky.



   

                   

Hey, it's the Sullster!



   

                   

See you on the scare floor,

buddy!



   

                   

Hey, Marge.

Hey, how was jury duty?



   

                   

Morning, Sulley!



   

                   

Hey!



   

                   

Hey, it's still leaning

to the left.



   

                   

It is not!



   

                   

Hey, fellas.



   

                   

Hey, Jerry.



   

                   

Hey, Mr. Sullivan!



   

                   

Guys, I told you,

call me Sulley.



   

                   

I don't think so.



   

                   

We just wanted to wish you

good luck today.



   

                   

Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!



   

                   

Come on, get lost, you two.



   

                   

You're making him lose

his focus.



   

                   

Oh. Sorry.



   

                   

See you later, fellas.



   

                   

Go get 'em, Mr. Sullivan!



   

                   

Quiet! You'll make him lose

his focus.



   

                   

Oh, no. Sorry!



   

                   

Shut up!



   

                   

Monsters, Inc. Please hold.



   

                   

Monsters, Inc.

I'll connect you.



   

                   

Ms. Fearmonger is on vacation.



   

                   

Would you like her voice mail?



   

                   

Oh, Schmoopsie-poo.



   

                   

Googley Bear!



   

                   

Happy birthday.



   

                   

Oh, Googley-woogley,

you remembered!



   

                   

Hey, Sulley-wulley.



   

                   

Oh, hey, Celia...



   

                   

weelia.



   

                   

Happy birthday.



   

                   

Thanks.



   

                   

So, uh... are we going

anywhere special tonight?



   

                   

I just got us

into a little place



   

                   

called, um... Harryhausen's.



   

                   

Harryhausen's?!



   

                   

But it's impossible to

get a reservation there!



   

                   

Not for Googley Bear.



   

                   

I will see you

at quitting time



   

                   

and not a minute later.



   

                   

Okay, sweetheart.



   

                   

Think romantical thoughts.



   

                   

You and me



   

                   

Me and you



   

                   

Both of us together!



   

                   

You know, pal, she's the one.



   

                   

That's it. She is the one!



   

                   

I'm happy for you.



   

                   

Oh, and, uh,

thanks for hooking me up



   

                   

with those reservations.



   

                   

Oh, no problem.



   

                   

They're under the name

Googley Bear.



   

                   

Oh, good ide...



   

                   

You know,

that wasn't very funny.



   

                   

What the...?



   

                   

Wazowski!



   

                   

What do you know?



   

                   

It scares little kids

and little monsters.



   

                   

I wasn't scared.



   

                   

I have... allergies.



   

                   

Uh-huh. Sure.



   

                   

Hey, Randall, save it for

the scare floor, will you?



   

                   

I'm in the zone today,

Sullivan.



   

                   

Going to be doing

some serious scaring.



   

                   

Putting up some big numbers.



   

                   

Wow, Randall.



   

                   

That's great.



   

                   

That should make it

even more humiliating



   

                   

when we break the record first.



   

                   

Ha, ha!



   

                   

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.



   

                   

Do you hear that?



   

                   

It's the winds of change.



   

                   

"You hear it? You hear

the winds of ch...?"



   

                   

Oh, what a creep.



   

                   

One of these days,

I am really...



   

                   

going to let you

teach that guy a lesson.



   

                   

Chalooby! Baby!



   

                   

Good morning, Roz



   

                   

my succulent

little garden snail.



   

                   

And who would

we be scaring today?



   

                   

Wazowski, you didn't file

your paperwork last night.



   

                   

Oh, that darn paperwork.



   

                   

Wouldn't it be easier

if it all just blew away?



   

                   

Don't let it happen again.



   

                   

Yes, well, I'll, uh...



   

                   

I'll try to be less careless.



   

                   

I'm watching you, Wazowski.



   

                   

Always watching.



   

                   

Whoo! She's nuts.



   

                   

Always!



   

                   

All scare floors are now active.



   

                   

Assistants, please report

to your stations.



   

                   

Okay, people, eastern seaboard

coming on-line.



   

                   

We got scarers coming out!



   

                   

Ooh, they're

so awesome.



   

                   

Hey... may the best monster win.



   

                   

I plan to.



   

                   

We are on in seven... six...



   

                   

five... four... three...



   

                   

two...



   

                   

You're the boss.

You're the boss.



   

                   

You're the big, hairy boss.



   

                   

Oh, I'm feeling good today,

Mikey!



   

                   

Yeah!



   

                   

Whoa!



   

                   

Attaboy.

Attaboy.



   

                   

Another door coming right up.



   

                   

You're still behind,

Randall.



   

                   

You know, maybe I should realign

the scream intake valve.



   

                   

Just get me another door!



   

                   

A door! Yes, door!



   

                   

Well, Jerry,

what's the damage so far?



   

                   

We may actually

make our quota today, sir.



   

                   

Hmm. First time in a month.



   

                   

Huh?!



   

                   

What happened?



   

                   

The kid almost touched me!



   

                   

She got this close to me!



   

                   

She wasn't scared of you?



   

                   

She was only six!



   

                   

I could've been dead!



   

                   

I could've died!



   

                   

Keep it together, man.



   

                   

Hey! We got a dead door

over here!



   

                   

- We're coming!

- Coming!



   

                   

- Look out!

- Out of the way!



   

                   

- Coming through!

- Excuse us.



   

                   

We've lost    doors

this week, sir.



   

                   

Oh, kids these days.



   

                   

They just don't get

scared like they used to.



   

                   

Let her rip!



   

                   

Uh, sir?



   

                   

What?!



   

                   

Look.



   

                   

Attention.



   

                   

We have a new scare leader:

Randall Boggs.



   

                   

Slumber party.



   

                   

Whoo!



   

                   

Never mind.



   

                   

Hey! Watch it!



   

                   

Well, James, that was

an impressive display!



   

                   

Oh, just doing my job,

Mr. Waternoose.



   

                   

Of course, I did learn

from the best.



   

                   

If I don't see a new door

at my station in five seconds



   

                   

I will personally put you

through the shredder!



   

                   

Hey, Wazowski, nice job!



   

                   

Those numbers are pretty sweet.



   

                   

Are they?



   

                   

You know,

I hadn't even noticed.



   

                   

And, uh...

how is Georgie doing?



   

                   

He's doing great!



   

                   

I love working

with that big guy.



   

                   

Keep the doors coming,

Charlie.



   

                   

I'm on a roll today.



   

                   

George and I

are like brothers.



   

                   

    ! We have a     !



   

                   

Red alert! Red alert!



   

                   

Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!



   

                   

George Sanderson



   

                   

please remain motionless.



   

                   

Prepare for decontamination.



   

                   

Get it off!



   

                   

Duck and cover, people!



   

                   

Oh, not the CDA.



   

                   

Move! Move! Move!



   

                   

Coming through, please.

Stand aside.



   

                   

Clear the contaminated area.



   

                   

This is a      in progress.



   

                   

Keep the area clear.



   

                   

Coming through. Watch yourself.



   

                   

Stand back.



   

                   

Careful.



   

                   

All clear.



   

                   

Situation is niner-niner-zero.



   

                   

Ready for decon.



   

                   

Hey, thanks, guys.



   

                   

That was a close one.



   

                   

Okay.



   

                   

Okay, people, take a break!



   

                   

We got to shut down

for a half-hour



   

                   

and reset the system.



   

                   

An entire scare floor

out of commission.



   

                   

What else can go wrong?



   

                   

Oh... what a day.



   

                   

We're just going through

a rough time, sir.



   

                   

Everyone knows you're going

to get us through it.



   

                   

Tell that

to the board of directors.



   

                   

James, this company



   

                   

has been in my family

for three generations.



   

                   

I would do anything

to keep it from going under.



   

                   

Oh, so would I, sir.



   

                   

Well...



   

                   

Say, I could use your help

with something.



   

                   

Anything, sir.



   

                   

You see, we've hired

some new scare recruits



   

                   

and frankly, they're...

they're, um... uh...



   

                   

Inexperienced?



   

                   

Oh, they stink!



   

                   

Uh-huh.



   

                   

And I thought maybe

you might come by tomorrow



   

                   

and give them a demonstration.



   

                   

Show them what it takes

to be a top scarer, huh?



   

                   

I'll start out with the old

Waternoose jump-and-growl.



   

                   

Ha! Oh, oh, yes!



   

                   

Now, that's my boy!



   

                   

Let's go, everybody!



   

                   

All doors must be returned!



   

                   

No exceptions!



   

                   

- Oh, yeah.

- Whoo!



   

                   

I've never seen anything

like you today.



   

                   

You were on a roll, my man.



   

                   

Another day like this



   

                   

and that scare record's

in the bag.



   

                   

That's right, baby!



   

                   

Uh-huh.



   

                   

So get this...

as if dinner wasn't enough



   

                   

I'm taking her to a monster

truck rally afterwards.



   

                   

Nice.



   

                   

What's on your agenda?



   

                   

I'm going to head home

and work out some more.



   

                   

Again? You know, there's

more to life than scaring.



   

                   

Whew. Hey, can I

borrow your odorant?



   

                   

Yeah. I got, uh...



   

                   

smelly garbage or old dumpster.



   

                   

You got low tide?



   

                   

No.



   

                   

How about wet dog?



   

                   

Yep. Stink it up.



   

                   

You know, I am so romantic



   

                   

sometimes I think

I should just marry myself.



   

                   

Give me a break, Mike.



   

                   

What a night of romance

I got ahead of me.



   

                   

Tonight is about me



   

                   

and Celia.



   

                   

Ooh, the love boat

is about to set sail.



   

                   

'Cause I got

to tell you, buddy



   

                   

that face of hers,

it just makes my heart go...



   

                   

Yikes!



   

                   

Hello, Wazowski.



   

                   

Fun-filled evening

planned for tonight?



   

                   

Well, as a matter of fact...



   

                   

Then I'm sure you

filed your paperwork



   

                   

correctly... for once.



   

                   

Your stunned silence

is very reassuring.



   

                   

Oh, no. My scare reports...

I left them on my desk



   

                   

and if I'm not at the restaurant

in five minutes



   

                   

they're going to give

our table away!



   

                   

What am I going to tell...



   

                   

Schmoopsie-poo?



   

                   

Hey, Googley Bear.

Want to get going?



   

                   

Do I ever!

It's just that...



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Uh, you know,

there's a small...



   

                   

I don't understand.



   

                   

It's just that I forgot

about some paperwork



   

                   

I was supposed to file.



   

                   

Mike was reminding me.



   

                   

Thanks, buddy.



   

                   

Whoo.



   

                   

I was? I mean, I was!

Yeah, I was.



   

                   

Oh, okay. Let's go then.



   

                   

We're going!



   

                   

On my desk, Sulley.



   

                   

The pink copies

go to Accounting



   

                   

the fuchsia ones

go to Purchasing



   

                   

and goldenrod ones

go to Roz.



   

                   

Huh!



   

                   

Leave the puce.



   

                   

Pink copies go to Accounting,

the fuchsia ones go to Roz.



   

                   

No, the fuchsia ones

go to Purchasing.



   

                   

The goldenrod ones go to Roz.



   

                   

Man, I have no idea

what puce is.



   

                   

Oh, that's puce.



   

                   

Hmm?



   

                   

Uh, hello?



   

                   

Anyone?



   

                   

There's a door here.



   

                   

Hmm.



   

                   

Hello?



   

                   

Hey.



   

                   

Psst.



   

                   

Anybody scaring in here?



   

                   

Hello?



   

                   

Yo!



   

                   

Hmm.



   

                   

Whoa! Ah! Ah!



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

Here.



   

                   

Gotcha!



   

                   

Eh!



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

Yeow!



   

                   

Eww.



   

                   

Whew.



   

                   

Kitty!



   

                   

No, no... stay back.



   

                   

Hmm.



   

                   

And hold it.



   

                   

Get a paper bag!



   

                   

Mmm.



   

                   

Oh, Michael, I've had

a lot of birthday...



   

                   

well, not a lot of birthdays



   

                   

but this is

the best birthday ever.



   

                   

Hmm.



   

                   

What are you looking at?



   

                   

I was just thinking



   

                   

about the first time

I laid eye on you...



   

                   

how pretty you looked.



   

                   

Stop it!



   

                   

Your hair was

shorter then.



   

                   

Mm-hmm. I'm thinking

about getting it cut.



   

                   

No, no, I like

it this length.



   

                   

I like everything about you.



   

                   

Just the other day



   

                   

someone asked me who I thought



   

                   

the most beautiful monster was

in all of Monstropolis.



   

                   

You know what I said?



   

                   

What did you say?



   

                   

I said...



   

                   

- Sulley?

- Sulley?



   

                   

No! No, no.



   

                   

That's not

what I was going to say.



   

                   

Mike, you're not making sense.



   

                   

Hi, guys!



   

                   

What a coincidence,

running into you here!



   

                   

Uh, I'm just going

to order something to go.



   

                   

Michael...



   

                   

Sulley!



   

                   

I wonder what's good here.



   

                   

Get out of here.

You're ruining everything.



   

                   

I went back to get

your paperwork



   

                   

and there was a door.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

A door?!



   

                   

Randall was in it.



   

                   

Wait a minute. Randall?



   

                   

That cheater!



   

                   

He's trying

to boost his numbers!



   

                   

There's something else.



   

                   

What?!



   

                   

Ook-lay in the ag-bay.



   

                   

What?!



   

                   

Look in the bag.



   

                   

What bag?



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

They don't have

anything I like here.



   

                   

So take care, Celia!



   

                   

Excuse me, sir.



   

                   

What's going on?



   

                   

Celia, please try

to understand.



   

                   

I have to do something!



   

                   

Michael?



   

                   

On three.



   

                   

One... two...



   

                   

A kid!



   

                   

Boo!



   

                   

A kid!



   

                   

There's a kid here...

a human kid!



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

Googley Bear!



   

                   

Come on!



   

                   

Let's get out of here!



   

                   

Please remain calm.



   

                   

This is not a drill.



   

                   

We have an     in progress.



   

                   

Please advise.



   

                   

Michael? Michael?



   

                   

Oh, Celia.



   

                   

- Please come with me.

- Ow. Stop pushing.



   

                   

Hey, get your hands off

my Schmoopsie-poo!



   

                   

Building clear.

Ready for decontamination.



   

                   

Well, I don't think that date

could have gone any worse.



   

                   

If witnesses are to be believed



   

                   

there has been

a child security breach



   

                   

for the first time

in monster history.



   

                   

We can neither confirm nor deny



   

                   

the presence of a human child

here tonight.



   

                   

Well, a kid flew right over me



   

                   

and blasted a car

with its laser vision!



   

                   

I tried to run from it,

but it picked me up



   

                   

with its mind powers

and shook me like a doll!



   

                   

It's true!

I saw the whole thing!



   

                   

It is my

professional opinion



   

                   

that now is the time

to... panic!



   

                   

Oh-oh.



   

                   

Oh, it's coming!



   

                   

It's coming!



   

                   

Boo!



   

                   

No, no, no, no, no!



   

                   

Come here, kid.



   

                   

Whee.



   

                   

No, don't touch those,

you little...!



   

                   

Oh, now



   

                   

those were alphabetized.



   

                   

It's okay, it's all right.



   

                   

As long as it doesn't

come near us



   

                   

we're going to be okay.



   

                   

Wanna ride on it!



   

                   

Da, da-da.



   

                   

Da-da-da.



   

                   

Oh, y-you like this?



   

                   

Fetch!



   

                   

Hey, hey, that's it!



   

                   

No one touches little Mikey!



   

                   

Mike, give her the bear.



   

                   

Oh, no.



   

                   

Make it stop, Sulley!



   

                   

Make it stop!



   

                   

Look! See the bear?



   

                   

Ooh, nice bear.



   

                   

Sulley!



   

                   

See?



   

                   

Ooh, bear, ooh.



   

                   

Oh, he's

a happy bear.



   

                   

He's not crying,

neither should you



   

                   

Or we'll be in trouble



   

                   

'Cause they're gonna find us



   

                   

So please stop crying



   

                   

Right now.



   

                   

Good, good, Sulley.

Keep it up.



   

                   

You're doing great.



   

                   

Ooh, the happy bear,

he has no...



   

                   

She touched me!



   

                   

Sulley, the bear!



   

                   

The bear!



   

                   

Give her the...



   

                   

Whoa!



   

                   

What was that?



   

                   

I have no idea



   

                   

but it would be really great



   

                   

if it didn't do it again.



   

                   

Shh, shh, shh.



   

                   

Shh...



   

                   

Shh.



   

                   

Shh...



   

                   

Ah!



   

                   

How could I do this?



   

                   

How could I be so stupid?



   

                   

This could destroy the company.



   

                   

The company?



   

                   

Who cares about the company?!



   

                   

What about us?



   

                   

That thing is

a killing machine!



   

                   

La-la-la-la-la-la



   

                   

I bet it's just waiting

for us to fall asleep



   

                   

and then wham!



   

                   

Oh, we're easy prey,

my friend... easy prey.



   

                   

We're sitting targets.



   

                   

Okay, look, I think



   

                   

I have a plan here.



   

                   

Using mainly spoons, we dig

a tunnel under the city



   

                   

and release it into the wild.



   

                   

Spoons.



   

                   

That's it, I'm out of ideas.



   

                   

We're closed.

Hot air balloon?



   

                   

Too expensive.

Giant slingshot?



   

                   

Too conspicuous.



   

                   

Enormous wooden horse?

Too Greek!



   

                   

No plan. No plan.



   

                   

Can't think. Can't think.



   

                   

Flatlining.



   

                   

Uh, Mike?



   

                   

I think she's getting tired.



   

                   

Well, then

why don't you



   

                   

find someplace

for it to sleep?



   

                   

While I think of a plan!



   

                   

Are you sleepy?



   

                   

You want to sleep?



   

                   

Is that what you want?



   

                   

Huh?



   

                   

Okay, all right.



   

                   

I'm making a nice little area

for you to...



   

                   

No. Hey, hey, that's my bed!



   

                   

You're going to get

your germs all over it.



   

                   

Fine.



   

                   

My chair is

more comfortable anyway.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

It's just a closet.



   

                   

Will you go to sleep?



   

                   

Hey, that looks like Randall.



   

                   

Randall's your monster.



   

                   

You think he's going

to come through the closet



   

                   

and scare you.



   

                   

Oh, boy, how do I explain this?



   

                   

Uh, it's empty.



   

                   

- See?

- Ah!



   

                   

No monster in here.



   

                   

Well, now there is



   

                   

but I'm not going to scare you.



   

                   

I'm off-duty.



   

                   

Okay.



   

                   

How about I sit here,

until you fall asleep?



   

                   

Go ahead.



   

                   

Go to sleep.



   

                   

Now.



   

                   

Now... go.



   

                   

Uh, you...



   

                   

go...



   

                   

to...



   

                   

sleep.



   

                   

Hey, Mike,

this might sound crazy



   

                   

but I don't think

that kid's dangerous.



   

                   

Really? Well, in that case,

let's keep it.



   

                   

I always wanted a pet

that could kill me!



   

                   

Now, look.



   

                   

What if we just put

her back in her door?



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Mike, think about it.



   

                   

If we send her back,

it's like it never happened.



   

                   

Everything goes back to normal.



   

                   

Is that a joke?



   

                   

Tell me you're joking.



   

                   

Sulley, I'd like to think

that, given the circumstances



   

                   

I have been extremely

forgiving up to now



   

                   

but that is a horrible idea!



   

                   

What are we going to do?



   

                   

March right out into

public with that thing?



   

                   

Then I guess we just waltz

right up to the factory, right?



   

                   

I can't believe we are waltzing

right up to the factory.



   

                   

Sulley, a mop, a couple of

lights and some chair fabric



   

                   

are not going

to fool anyone!



   

                   

Just think about

a few names, will you?



   

                   

Loch Ness, Bigfoot,

the Abominable Snowman...



   

                   

they all got one thing

in common, pal... banishment.



   

                   

We could be next!



   

                   

Don't panic...

we can do this.



   

                   

Hey, how you doing, Frank?



   

                   

Hey, guys.



   

                   

Everything's going



   

                   

to be okay.



   

                   

Number One wants this place

dusted for prints.



   

                   

Careful with that.



   

                   

I got a good view from here.



   

                   

A little lower.



   

                   

This was recovered

at the scene.



   

                   

Don't panic. Don't panic!



   

                   

Don't tell me not to panic.



   

                   

Just keep it together.



   

                   

Everything is not okay!



   

                   

Boo.



   

                   

...could be contaminated.



   

                   

Gentlemen, safety



   

                   

is our number one concern.



   

                   

If there's anything that...



   

                   

not now, not now.



   

                   

Oh, hello, little one.



   

                   

Where did you come from?



   

                   

Mr. Waternoose!



   

                   

Ah, James!

Is this one yours?



   

                   

Actually, that's my, uh,

cousin's sister's daughter, sir.



   

                   

Yeah, it's, uh...



   

                   

"Bring an Obscure

Relative to Work Day."



   

                   

Hmm, must have missed the memo.



   

                   

Well, listen, James



   

                   

why don't you stop by

the simulator after lunch today



   

                   

and give us

that scare demonstration



   

                   

we talked about, huh?



   

                   

Oh, oh, sir, uh...



   

                   

Excuse me,

Mr. Waternoose?



   

                   

Yes, yes, I'm coming.



   

                   

All right then, I'll see

you this afternoon, James.



   

                   

That is, if these gentlemen

haven't shut us down.



   

                   

Oh, boy.



   

                   

Oh, a scare demo.



   

                   

Well, that is great.



   

                   

Why am I

the last to know?



   

                   

We can bring your cousin's

sister's daughter along.



   

                   

She'll be a big hit!



   

                   

Halt!



   

                   

Stop him!



   

                   

Hold him down.



   

                   

Come on, the coast is clear.



   

                   

Okay, all we have to do

is get rid of that thing.



   

                   

So, wait here while

I get its card key.



   

                   

But she can't stay here.



   

                   

This is the men's room.



   

                   

That is the weirdest thing

you have ever said.



   

                   

It's fine. It's okay.



   

                   

Look, it loves it here!



   

                   

It's dancing with joy!



   

                   

Uh, uh, uh, uh.



   

                   

I'll be right back

with its door key.



   

                   

That's a cute little

dance you've got.



   

                   

It almost looks

like you've got to...



   

                   

Oh.



   

                   

Uh, are you done in there?



   

                   

Ah! Sorry. Sorry.



   

                   

Okay, you

finished now, right?



   

                   

Hello?



   

                   

Boo.



   

                   

Where did she go?



   

                   

Oh, did she disappear?



   

                   

Did she turn invisible?



   

                   

I just have no idea.



   

                   

Gotcha!



   

                   

Boo.



   

                   

Hey, you're good.



   

                   

Be relaxed,

be relaxed, be relaxed.



   

                   

Roz, my tender, oozing blossom



   

                   

you're looking fabulous today.



   

                   

Is that a new haircut?



   

                   

Come on, tell me.



   

                   

It's a new haircut, isn't it?



   

                   

That's got to be a new haircut.



   

                   

New makeup? You've had a lift.



   

                   

You've had a tuck.

You've had something.



   

                   

Something has been

inserted in your skin



   

                   

that makes you look like...



   

                   

Listen, I need a favor.



   

                   

Randall was working

late last night



   

                   

out on the scare floor.



   

                   

I really need the key

for the door he was using.



   

                   

Well, isn't that nice?



   

                   

But guess what?



   

                   

You didn't turn in

your paperwork last night.



   

                   

He didn't... I... no paperwork?



   

                   

This office is now closed.



   

                   

Ready or not, here I come!



   

                   

I'm getting warmer.



   

                   

Any second now.



   

                   

Fee fi fo...



   

                   

What are you doing?!



   

                   

L-I'm looking for the kid.



   

                   

You lost it?!



   

                   

No, no, she was just...



   

                   

Here she is.



   

                   

Hey, what's the matter?



   

                   

I already told your buddies

I haven't seen anything.



   

                   

All right, carry on.



   

                   

Randall!

Thank goodness!



   

                   

What are we going to do

about the child?



   

                   

Shh!



   

                   

Shh, shh, shh.



   

                   

The front page!

It's on the front page.



   

                   

The child...

the one you were after.



   

                   

Will you be quiet?!



   

                   

Don't you think I'm aware

of the situation?



   

                   

I was up all night

trying to find it.



   

                   

I did a simple

calculation



   

                   

factoring in the size

of the sushi restaurant.



   

                   

The child may have escaped!



   

                   

Yeah, well, until

we know for sure



   

                   

we're going to act like nothing

happened, understand?



   

                   

You just get the machine

up and running.



   

                   

I'll take care of the kid.



   

                   

And when I find whoever

let it out, they're dead!



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

Why are you still here?



   

                   

Come on, go!



   

                   

Move! Now!



   

                   

Ow, ow! I'm not here.



   

                   

They're gone.



   

                   

Eww.



   

                   

This is bad.

This is so very bad.



   

                   

What were they talking

about a machine?



   

                   

Who cares? Oh!



   

                   

Look, don't panic...

all we have to do



   

                   

is call her door down

and send her home.



   

                   

You're right, you're right.



   

                   

We're just two regular joes

on our way to work.



   

                   

We will blend right in.



   

                   

Top of the mornin', fellas!



   

                   

Hey, what's shakin', bacon?



   

                   

Did you lose weight?



   

                   

Or a limb?



   

                   

You have her card key, right?



   

                   

Of course

I have her card key.



   

                   

I told you

I'd get her card key.



   

                   

I went and got her card key



   

                   

and now I have her card key.



   

                   

Okay, here we go.



   

                   

Take care of yourself.



   

                   

Try not to run

through any more closets.



   

                   

Mike, that's not her door.



   

                   

What are you talking about?



   

                   

Of course it's her door.

It's her door.



   

                   

No, her door was white

and it had flowers on it.



   

                   

No. It must have been

dark last night



   

                   

because this is its door.



   

                   

Hey, you hear that?



   

                   

Sounds like

fun in there!



   

                   

Okay, send me a postcard, kid.



   

                   

That's Mike Wazowski, care of



   

                   

   Mike-Wazowski-

you-got-your-life-back Lane.



   

                   

Mowki Kowski.



   

                   

Very good. Now bon voyage!



   

                   

Bye-bye!

Come on.



   

                   

Look at the stick.

See the stick?



   

                   

Go get the stick! Go fetch.



   

                   

Mike, this isn't Boo's door.



   

                   

Boo? What's Boo?



   

                   

That's what I decided

to call her.



   

                   

Is there a problem?



   

                   

Sulley, you're not

supposed to name it.



   

                   

Once you name it, you start

getting attached to it!



   

                   

Now put that thing



   

                   

back where it came from,

or so help me...



   

                   

Oh, hey!



   

                   

We're rehearsing a scene

for the upcoming company play



   

                   

called Put That Thing

Back Where It Came From



   

                   

Or So Help Me.



   

                   

It's a musical!



   

                   

Put that thing back where

it came from or so help me



   

                   

Bom-bom, bom-bom,

bom-bom...



   

                   

So help me, so help me.



   

                   

And cut!



   

                   

We're still working on it.



   

                   

It's a work in progress



   

                   

but, hey, we need ushers.



   

                   

Sulley, I've had enough.



   

                   

Now say good-bye to...

where'd it go?



   

                   

What'd you do with it?



   

                   

Where is she?



   

                   

I don't believe it.



   

                   

She got away from you again?!



   

                   

Well, that is just...



   

                   

Wait a minute.



   

                   

The sun is coming up.



   

                   

This is perfect!



   

                   

She's gone!



   

                   

Hey, hey, hey, hey.



   

                   

Where are you going?



   

                   

Sulley, please,

don't blow this.



   

                   

Not when we're so close

to breaking the record.



   

                   

Somebody else

will find the kid.



   

                   

It'll be their problem,

not ours!



   

                   

She's out of our hair!



   

                   

What are you two doing?



   

                   

They're rehearsing a play.



   

                   

She's out of our hair!



   

                   

Can it, Wazowski!



   

                   

So, what do you think of that

kid getting out, Sullivan?



   

                   

Pretty crazy, huh?



   

                   

Oh, yeah, crazy.



   

                   

Word on the street is the kid's



   

                   

been traced back

to this factory.



   

                   

You haven't seen anything,

have you?



   

                   

Uh, well, uh...



   

                   

No, no way!



   

                   

But if it was an inside job



   

                   

I'd put my money on Waxford.



   

                   

Waxford?



   

                   

Yeah, the one at station six.



   

                   

You know,

he's got them shifty eyes.



   

                   

Hey, Waxford!



   

                   

Sulley!



   

                   

Michael Wazowski!



   

                   

Last night was one

of the worst nights



   

                   

of my entire life, bar none!



   

                   

I thought

you cared about me.



   

                   

Honey, please.



   

                   

Schmoopsie, I thought

you liked sushi.



   

                   

Sushi? Sushi?!!



   

                   

You think this is about sushi?!



   

                   

Wazowski!



   

                   

Michael! Mike...



   

                   

Men.



   

                   

Breathe. Keep breathing.



   

                   

Whew.



   

                   

Yikes!



   

                   

Where's the kid?



   

                   

Kid? What kid?



   

                   

It's here in

the factory, isn't it?



   

                   

You're not pinning this on me.



   

                   

It never would have gotten out



   

                   

if you hadn't been

cheating last night!



   

                   

Cheating?



   

                   

Cheating. Right.



   

                   

Okay, I think I know how

to make this all go away.



   

                   

What happens when the whistle

blows in five minutes?



   

                   

Uh... I get a time-out?



   

                   

Everyone goes to lunch!



   

                   

Which means the scare floor

will be...?



   

                   

Painted?



   

                   

Empty! It'll be

empty, you idiot!



   

                   

You see that clock?



   

                   

When the big hand

is pointing up



   

                   

and the little hand

is pointing up



   

                   

the kid's door

will be in my station.



   

                   

But when the big hand

points down



   

                   

the door will be gone.



   

                   

You have until then

to put the kid back.



   

                   

Get the picture?



   

                   

Boo!



   

                   

No.



   

                   

Hey, you! Halt!



   

                   

He's the one.



   

                   

The one from the commercial!



   

                   

Affirmative. That's him.



   

                   

Can we get an autograph?



   

                   

Oh, oh, sure. No problem.



   

                   

You can make that out

to Bethany, my daughter.



   

                   

Yes. Let's see...



   

                   

"From your scary friend



   

                   

best wishes..."



   

                   

So I said,

"If you talk to me



   

                   

like that again,

we're through!"



   

                   

What'd she say?



   

                   

You know my mom.



   

                   

She sent me to my room.



   

                   

See you guys later,

take it easy.



   

                   

Bottoms up!



   

                   

No!



   

                   

Whoa!



   

                   

Hey.



   

                   

Oh, well, hello, there.



   

                   

What's your name?



   

                   

Mike Wazowski!



   

                   

Sulley!



   

                   

Oh, Sulley.



   

                   

Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.



   

                   

Hey, you guys seen

Sulley anywhere?



   

                   

Nope. Sorry.



   

                   

Oh, Sulley!



   

                   

Boy, Wazowski looks

like he's in trouble.



   

                   

    !



   

                   

We have a     !



   

                   

Oh, dear.



   

                   

Get him!



   

                   

Sulley? Sulley!



   

                   

Sulley!



    

                   

Oh, great news, pal.



    

                   

I got us a way out of this mess



    

                   

but we got to hurry.



    

                   

Where is it?



    

                   

Sull, that's a cube of garbage.



    

                   

Uh-oh.



    

                   

L-I can still hear

her little voice.



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

Hey, I can hear her, too.



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

How many kids

you got in there?



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

Boo, oh,

you're all right!



    

                   

I was so worried!



    

                   

Don't you ever run away from me

again, young lady!



    

                   

Oh, but I'm so glad

you're safe.



    

                   

My, what an affectionate father.



    

                   

Actually, she's

my cousin's sister's...



    

                   

Okay, Sulley.



    

                   

That's enough. Let's go.



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

Yeah, yeah.



    

                   

Step aside, kid. We're in a...



    

                   

Will you stop

making Boo laugh?



    

                   

I didn't, so come on!



    

                   

I still don't understand.

You've got Boo's door?



    

                   

I'll explain later.

Run.



    

                   

Okay, let's move,

let's move, let's move.



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

Oh, please be there, please

be there, please be there.



    

                   

There it is!



    

                   

Just like Randall said!



    

                   

Randall? Wait a minute.



    

                   

Oh, hey.



    

                   

One, two, three, four!



    

                   

Get the kid back

through the door!



    

                   

Hey, hey.



    

                   

We're going to get

our lives back.



    

                   

The nightmare is over.



    

                   

Hey, it's okay, Boo.



    

                   

What's the matter?



    

                   

Come on, it's time to move!



    

                   

Mike, what are you thinking?



    

                   

We can't trust Randall.



    

                   

He's after Boo.



    

                   

Who cares? Let's go.



    

                   

This is a limited time offer.



    

                   

No, no.



    

                   

I don't like this.



    

                   

Look, Sulley, you wanted

her door and there it is.



    

                   

Now, let's move.



    

                   

No, Mike.



    

                   

You want me to prove

everything's on the up-and-up?



    

                   

Fine! He wants the door,

I get the door...



    

                   

Mike, wait!



    

                   

He's a paranoid delusional

furball.



    

                   

Mike!



    

                   

Shh, shh, shh.



    

                   

Hey, Sulley,

where you been all day?



    

                   

Sulley? Sulley?



    

                   

Huh?



    

                   

Mike?



    

                   

Mike?



    

                   

Where are you?



    

                   

You in there?



    

                   

Where are you, buddy?



    

                   

Mike?



    

                   

Hey.



    

                   

Boo, way to go.



    

                   

It's okay.



    

                   

Yes! I got the kid!



    

                   

Oh, huzzah!



    

                   

That's great news.



    

                   

Not that I was concerned,

of course.



    

                   

Just get over here and help me!



    

                   

Come on, come on, come on.



    

                   

While we're young here, Fungus!



    

                   

Kid needs to take

off a few pounds.



    

                   

Wazowski?!



    

                   

Where is it,

you little one-eyed cretin?



    

                   

Okay, first of all,

it's cree-tin.



    

                   

If you're going to threaten me,

do it properly.



    

                   

Second of all, you're nuts

if you think kidnapping me



    

                   

is going to help you cheat

your way to the top!



    

                   

You still think this is about

that stupid scare record?



    

                   

Well... I did, right up

until you chuckled like that



    

                   

and now I'm thinking

I should just get out of here.



    

                   

I am about to revolutionize

the scaring industry



    

                   

and when I do, even

the great James P. Sullivan



    

                   

is going to be working for me.



    

                   

Well



    

                   

somebody's certainly

been a busy bee.



    

                   

First, I need to know

where the kid is



    

                   

and you're going to tell me.



    

                   

Yeah, I don't know anything.



    

                   

Uh-huh, sure.



    

                   

I don't.



    

                   

I mean, I don't.



    

                   

Oh-oh.



    

                   

What's that?



    

                   

Come on. Wait, wait, wait.



    

                   

Oh-oh. Oh-oh. Oh, come on.



    

                   

No, no, no, no, no.



    

                   

Come on, hey, hey, hey.



    

                   

This thing is moving.



    

                   

I don't like big...



    

                   

moving things that are

moving towards me.



    

                   

No! Come on!



    

                   

Hey, Randall!



    

                   

Say hello

to the scream extractor.



    

                   

Hello.



    

                   

Come on, where you going?



    

                   

We'll talk.



    

                   

Come on, we'll have a latte!



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

We can talk about this.



    

                   

What's that thing?

What is that thing?



    

                   

Wait, wait, wait!



    

                   

Stop, stop!



    

                   

No, no!



    

                   

Come on, hey!



    

                   

Help! Help! Help!



    

                   

Help!



    

                   

Oh, for...



    

                   

What did you

do wrong this time?



    

                   

I don't know.



    

                   

I calibrated the drive...



    

                   

Go check the machine!



    

                   

There must be something wrong

with the scream intake valve.



    

                   

That's the problem

with these      units...



    

                   

Huh?



    

                   

Hmm.



    

                   

Psst!



    

                   

Fungus. Fungus.



    

                   

You like cars, huh?



    

                   

'Cause I got a really nice car.



    

                   

If you let me go,

I'll give you...



    

                   

a ride in the car.



    

                   

Please, Fungus?



    

                   

I'm sorry, Wazowski,

but Randall said



    

                   

I'm not allowed to fraternize

with victims of his evil plot.



    

                   

Hmm...



    

                   

What happened?



    

                   

Where's Wazowski?



    

                   

Where is he?!



    

                   

Come on!



    

                   

This is crazy.

He's going to kill us!



    

                   

Careful. That could be

contaminated.



    

                   

We got to get out of here now!



    

                   

We can start a whole new life

somewhere far away.



    

                   

Good-bye, Monsters, Inc.!



    

                   

Good-bye, Mr. Waternoose!



    

                   

No, Mike, wait!



    

                   

Hey, what are you doing?



    

                   

Follow me. I have an idea.



    

                   

No! No, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no...



    

                   

Simulation terminated.



    

                   

No, no, no, no, no.



    

                   

What was that?



    

                   

You're trying to scare the kid,

not lull it to sleep.



    

                   

I was going

for a snake/ninja approach



    

                   

with a little hissing.



    

                   

How many times

do I have to tell you?



    

                   

It's all about presence!



    

                   

About how you enter the room!



    

                   

Mr. Waternoose!



    

                   

James! Perfect timing.



    

                   

No, no.

Sir, you don't understand.



    

                   

Ah, now, show these monsters

how it's done.



    

                   

What? No, no, I can't...



    

                   

Sir... sir, you have



    

                   

to listen to me.



    

                   

Pay attention, everyone.



    

                   

You're about to see



    

                   

the best in the business.



    

                   

Reset the simulator.



    

                   

But-but, sir!



    

                   

Good night, sweetheart.



    

                   

Night, Mom.



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

No, Boo, no, no!



    

                   

Now, give us a big, loud roar.



    

                   

Mr. Waternoose,

there's no time for this.



    

                   

Come on. What are you

waiting for? Roar!



    

                   

But-but-but, sir!



    

                   

Roar!



    

                   

Well done.



    

                   

Well done, James.



    

                   

Boo?



    

                   

- All right, gentlemen,

I hope you've learned...

- Right this way, everyone.



    

                   

...a valuable lesson

in scaring today.



    

                   

Boo.



    

                   

Boo?



    

                   

Boo, it's me.



    

                   

The child!



    

                   

Sir, she isn't toxic.



    

                   

I know it sounds

crazy, but trust me.



    

                   

Boo?



    

                   

No, no, no, no.



    

                   

It's okay.



    

                   

I was just...



    

                   

No, no, no, no, no,

don't be scared.



    

                   

That wasn't real.



    

                   

It's just a...



    

                   

I was just...



    

                   

No...



    

                   

Boo.



    

                   

...and he was going

to test it out



    

                   

on that sweet, little girl.



    

                   

- Boo.

- Now that we have her...



    

                   

...he is trying to kill us.



    

                   

This whole thing

is Randall's fault.



    

                   

Randall?



    

                   

Yes. And we can take you to his

secret lab, which is right here



    

                   

in this factory.



    

                   

How could this happen?



    

                   

Oh, how could this happen?



    

                   

Does anyone else

know about this?



    

                   

No, sir.



    

                   

Good.



    

                   

This company can't afford

any more bad publicity.



    

                   

Now, before we do

anything else, let's...



    

                   

take care of the child.



    

                   

Oh, I never thought things

would come to this...



    

                   

not in my factory.



    

                   

I'm sorry you boys

got mixed up in this.



    

                   

Especially you, James.



    

                   

But now we can set



    

                   

everything straight again

for the good of the company.



    

                   

Uh...



    

                   

sir, that's not her door.



    

                   

I know, I know.



    

                   

It's yours.



    

                   

No!



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

No! No!



    

                   

No! No! No! No!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

It's too late!



    

                   

We're banished, genius.



    

                   

We're in the human world!



    

                   

Oh, what a great idea, going

to your old pal Waternoose!



    

                   

Too bad he was in

on the whole thing!



    

                   

All you had to do was listen

to me... just once!



    

                   

But you didn't, did you?



    

                   

You're still not listening!



    

                   

Take that!



    

                   

Welcome to the Himalayas!



    

                   

"Abominable"!



    

                   

Can you believe that?



    

                   

Do I look abominable to you?



    

                   

Why can't they call me

the Adorable Snowman or...



    

                   

or the Agreeable Snowman,

for crying out loud?



    

                   

I'm a nice guy.



    

                   

Snow cone?



    

                   

Yuck.



    

                   

No, no, no.



    

                   

Don't worry... it's lemon.



    

                   

Uh, how about you, big fella?



    

                   

Snow cone?



    

                   

Did you see the way she...

Iooked at me?



    

                   

Ah, poor guy.



    

                   

I understand.



    

                   

It ain't easy being banished.



    

                   

Take my buddy, Bigfoot.



    

                   

When he was banished



    

                   

he fashioned an enormous diaper

out of poison ivy.



    

                   

Wore it on his head

like a tiara.



    

                   

Called himself King ltchy.



    

                   

Ah, it won't be so hard for

you guys, though, you know.



    

                   

I mean, how lucky

can you get?



    

                   

Banished with your

best friend.



    

                   

He is not my friend.



    

                   

Oh. I just assumed you

were buddies, you know



    

                   

when I saw you out

there in the snow



    

                   

hugging and all that.



    

                   

Look at that big jerk.



    

                   

Ruined my life, and for what?



    

                   

A stupid kid!



    

                   

Because of you, I am now stuck



    

                   

in this frozen wasteland!



    

                   

Wasteland?



    

                   

I think you mean wonderland!



    

                   

I mean, how about

all this fabulous snow, huh?



    

                   

Oh, and wait till you see

the local village.



    

                   

Cutest thing in the world.



    

                   

I haven't even mentioned

all the free yak's milk.



    

                   

What... what did you say?



    

                   

Yak's milk.



    

                   

Milking a yak

ain't exactly a picnic.



    

                   

You know, once you pick

the hairs out



    

                   

it's very nutritious.



    

                   

No, no. Something

about a village.



    

                   

Where? Are there kids in it?



    

                   

Kids? Sure.



    

                   

Tough kids, sissy kids,

kids who climb on rocks...



    

                   

Where is it?!



    

                   

It's at the bottom

of the mountain.



    

                   

Around a three-day hike.



    

                   

Oh, three days?!



    

                   

We need to get there now!



    

                   

You want to go to the village?



    

                   

Okay, rule number one

out here.



    

                   

Always...



    

                   

No.



    

                   

Never go out in a blizzard.



    

                   

We need to get to Boo.



    

                   

Boo?!



    

                   

What about us?



    

                   

Ever since that kid came in



    

                   

you've ignored

everything I've said



    

                   

and now look where we are!



    

                   

Oh, we were about

to break the record, Sulley.



    

                   

We would have had it made!



    

                   

None of that matters now.



    

                   

None of it matter...



    

                   

Wa-wait a second.



    

                   

None of it matters?



    

                   

Okay.



    

                   

That's... no. Good. Great.



    

                   

So, now the truth comes out,

doesn't it?



    

                   

Oh, would you look at that?



    

                   

We're out of snow cones, uh...



    

                   

Let me... just go outside



    

                   

and make some more.



    

                   

Sulley, what about everything

we ever worked for?



    

                   

Does that matter? Huh?



    

                   

And what about Celia?



    

                   

I am never... never

going to see her again.



    

                   

Doesn't that matter?



    

                   

What about me?



    

                   

I'm your pal.



    

                   

I'm... I'm your best friend.



    

                   

Don't I matter?



    

                   

I'm sorry, Mike.



    

                   

I'm sorry we're stuck out here.



    

                   

I didn't mean

for this to happen.



    

                   

But Boo's in trouble.



    

                   

I think there might

be a way to save her



    

                   

if we can just

get down to that...



    

                   

"We"?



    

                   

Whoa, whoa, whoa. "We"?



    

                   

No.



    

                   

There's no "we" this time, pal.



    

                   

If-if-if you want

to go out there



    

                   

and freeze to death



    

                   

you be my guest...



    

                   

because you're on your own.



    

                   

Hey, I got more snow cones!



    

                   

Ohh!



    

                   

Ahh!



    

                   

Ahh!



    

                   

Oh, come on, now, George.

I know you can do this.



    

                   

I picked out an easy door

for you... in Nepal.



    

                   

Nice, quiet Nepal.



    

                   

You know, you're right.



    

                   

Here, take this.



    

                   

Go get 'em, Georgie!



    

                   

Gangway! Look out!

Coming through!



    

                   

Sorry, George.



    

                   

Hey, you can't just...



    

                   

  ...



    

                   

Out of the way!



    

                   

- Hey!

- Whoa!



    

                   

Don't!



    

                   

Finally!



    

                   

I never should have

trusted you with this.



    

                   

Because of you, I had

to banish my top scarer!



    

                   

With this machine,

we won't need scarers.



    

                   

Besides, Sullivan got

what he deserved.



    

                   

Sullivan was twice the scarer

you will ever be!



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

Sullivan?



    

                   

Wh-whoa!



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

Sorry, Boo.



    

                   

Stop him!



    

                   

Let's get you home.



    

                   

Ooh!



    

                   

Finish him off!



    

                   

Oh! Ooh! Oh!



    

                   

You don't know how long



    

                   

I've wanted to do

that, Sullivan.



    

                   

Hah!



    

                   

Ooh!



    

                   

Ooh!



    

                   

Mike?!



    

                   

Look, it's not that I

don't care about the kid.



    

                   

Mike, you don't understand.



    

                   

Yes, I do. I was

just mad, that's all.



    

                   

I needed some time to think.



    

                   

But you shouldn't

have left me out there.



    

                   

I'm being attacked!



    

                   

No, I'm not attacking you.



    

                   

I'm trying to be honest.



    

                   

Just hear me out.



    

                   

You and I are a team.



    

                   

Nothing is more important

than our friendship.



    

                   

L-l-I know, kid.



    

                   

He's too sensitive.



    

                   

Come on, pal.



    

                   

If you start crying,

I'm going to cry



    

                   

and I'll never get through this.



    

                   

I'm sorry

I wasn't there for you



    

                   

but I am now.



    

                   

Ow!



    

                   

Sulley, I am baring

my soul here.



    

                   

The least you could do

is pay attention!



    

                   

Hey, look at that...

it's Randall! It's...



    

                   

Oh.



    

                   

Come on!



    

                   

Get up!



    

                   

There can't be any witnesses.



    

                   

There won't be.



    

                   

I'm glad you came back, Mike.



    

                   

Somebody's got to take care

of you, you big hairball.



    

                   

Ow!



    

                   

Schmoopsie-poo,

I really can't talk.



    

                   

Come on!



    

                   

Michael, if you don't tell me



    

                   

what's going on right

now, we are through!



    

                   

You hear me? Through!



    

                   

Here's the truth.



    

                   

You know the kid that they're

looking for... Sulley let her in.



    

                   

We tried to send her back



    

                   

but Waternoose

had this secret plot



    

                   

and now Randall's right behind

us and he's trying to kill us!



    

                   

You expect me to believe that

pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!



    

                   

Move it! Look out, you...



    

                   

Oh!



    

                   

...idiot!



    

                   

Look out. Coming through,

here, coming through!



    

                   

Make way. Move it!



    

                   

Hurry up, hurry up.



    

                   

There they are!



    

                   

Attention, employees:

Randall Boggs



    

                   

has just broken

the all-time scare record.



    

                   

Huh?



    

                   

No, I didn't.



    

                   

Get out of my way!



    

                   

Go get 'em, Googley Bear!



    

                   

There it is!



    

                   

Get off my tail!



    

                   

Let me through!



    

                   

Sulley,

what are you doing?



    

                   

Grab on, Mike!



    

                   

Are you out of your...?



    

                   

Sulley, what are we doing?



    

                   

We have to get Boo's door

and find a station.



    

                   

What a plan...

simple, yet insane!



    

                   

Whoa.



    

                   

Oh, boy.



    

                   

Hold on!



    

                   

Wow!



    

                   

Don't look down!



    

                   

I'm gonna be sick.

I'm gonna be sick!



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

Oh, no!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

Aah...



    

                   

- Boo's door?

- There it is!



    

                   

How are we supposed

to get to it now?



    

                   

Oh, it's a dead end, Sulley!



    

                   

There he is.



    

                   

Make her laugh.



    

                   

What, Sulley?!



    

                   

Just do it!



    

                   

Oh... ow!



    

                   

Get it open.



    

                   

Here he comes.



    

                   

Give me that kid!



    

                   

Why couldn't we

get banished here?



    

                   

Come on. We got to

find another door.



    

                   

Look, Boo's door!



    

                   

There he is!



    

                   

Hurry up, hurry up!



    

                   

Give me your hand.



    

                   

Come on, it slides,

it slides!



    

                   

Ooh, right, right, right.



    

                   

Jump! I'm behind you!



    

                   

Come on!



    

                   

Hurry up! Keep moving!



    

                   

Get inside!



    

                   

Ooh! That was weird.



    

                   

Mike?



    

                   

Oh, sorry, buddy.



    

                   

Oh!



    

                   

I hope that hurt, lizard boy!



    

                   

Great job, buddy. We lost him.



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

Ha, ha!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

Nice working with you!



    

                   

Get it open!



    

                   

- I'm trying!

- Open the door!



    

                   

Come on, get in here!



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

There they are!



    

                   

Sulley, what are you doing?



    

                   

Sulley!



    

                   

Looks like we caught

the express, pal.



    

                   

Do you see them?



    

                   

Straight ahead!



    

                   

No...



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

Look at everybody's

favorite scarer now!



    

                   

You stupid, pathetic waste!



    

                   

You've been number one

for too long, Sullivan.



    

                   

Now your time is up!



    

                   

And don't worry.



    

                   

I'll take good care of the kid.



    

                   

No!



    

                   

She's not scared

of you anymore.



    

                   

Looks like you're out of a job.



    

                   

All right, come on,

over the plate.



    

                   

Let's see

the ol' stuff here, pal.



    

                   

Come on, now, chuck him,

chuck him, baby. Hum, baby.



    

                   

Hum, baby, here's the pitch.



    

                   

Wait, please, don't,

don't, don't!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

And he is... out of here!



    

                   

Mama, another gator

got in the house.



    

                   

Another gator?!



    

                   

Give me that shovel! Come here!



    

                   

Get him, Mama! Get that gator!



    

                   

Care to do the honors, Mikey?



    

                   

With pleasure.



    

                   

That's right, Boo.



    

                   

You did it.



    

                   

You beat him.



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

Okay, Boo, it's time to go home.



    

                   

Take care of yourself,

and be a good girl, okay?



    

                   

Oh, no!



    

                   

The power's out!



    

                   

Make her laugh again.



    

                   

All right, I got a move here.



    

                   

It'll bring down the house.



    

                   

Up...



    

                   

Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.



    

                   

What?! What'd you do,

forget to check



    

                   

if her stupid hood was up



    

                   

ya big dope?!



    

                   

Uncle Mike, try not to yell

in front of her.



    

                   

You know we still need her

to laugh.



    

                   

Right.



    

                   

Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!



    

                   

Funny, right? Huh?

See what the...



    

                   

These are the jokes, kid.



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

What's happening?



    

                   

Hold on!



    

                   

When the door lands

in this station, cut the power.



    

                   

You'll have the child

and the criminals responsible



    

                   

for this whole mess.



    

                   

Great.

A welcoming committee!



    

                   

What are we going to do?!



    

                   

This is the CDA.



    

                   

Come out slowly



    

                   

with the child in plain sight.



    

                   

Okay, okay.



    

                   

You got us.



    

                   

Here we are.



    

                   

Here's the kid.



    

                   

I'm cooperating.



    

                   

But before you take us away,

I have one thing to say:



    

                   

Catch!



    

                   

    !



    

                   

We have a toxic projectile!



    

                   

Halt! After the suspect!



    

                   

Cover the area!

Bring in reinforcements!



    

                   

Stop him!



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

Don't let them get away.



    

                   

What...?!



    

                   

No, wait, wait!



    

                   

Come back! He has the child!



    

                   

Sullivan? Sullivan!



    

                   

Give me the child!



    

                   

Me not go!



    

                   

Give her to me!



    

                   

Open this door!

Open this door!



    

                   

Hey!



    

                   

Sullivan!



    

                   

Don't do it.



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

Don't go in that room!



    

                   

I think we stopped him, Boo.



    

                   

You're safe now.



    

                   

You be a good girl, okay?



    

                   

This has gone far enough, James.



    

                   

She's home now!

Just leave her alone!



    

                   

I can't do that!



    

                   

She's seen too much.



    

                   

You both have.



    

                   

It doesn't have to be this way.



    

                   

I have no choice!



    

                   

Times have changed.



    

                   

Scaring isn't enough anymore.



    

                   

But kidnapping children?!



    

                   

I'll kidnap

a thousand children



    

                   

before I let this company die



    

                   

and I'll silence anyone



    

                   

who gets in my way!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

Good night, Mom.



    

                   

Good night, sweetheart.



    

                   

Good night, Mom.



    

                   

What, wh-what is this?!

What? Who? Huh?



    

                   

Simulation terminated.

Simulation terminated.



    

                   

Well, I don't know

about the rest of you guys



    

                   

but I spotted

several big mistakes.



    

                   

But-but-but how-how did...?

How did...?



    

                   

You know what?



    

                   

Let's watch my favorite part

again... shall we?



    

                   

I'll kidnap a thousand children

before I let this company die.



    

                   

What...? Wha...?



    

                   

I'll kidnap

a thousand children before...



    

                   

Shh, shh, shh, shh!



    

                   

Shh!



    

                   

I'll get him.



    

                   

All right, come with us, sir.



    

                   

Wh-what are you doing?



    

                   

Take your hands off me!



    

                   

You can't arrest me!



    

                   

I hope you're happy, Sullivan!



    

                   

You've destroyed this company.

Monsters, Incorporated is dead!



    

                   

Where will everyone

get their scream now?!



    

                   

The energy crisis

will only get worse



    

                   

because of you!



    

                   

Stay where you are.



    

                   

Huh?



    

                   

Number One

wants to talk to you.



    

                   

Attention!



    

                   

Hello, boys.



    

                   

Roz?!



    

                   

Two and a half years

of undercover work



    

                   

were almost wasted



    

                   

when you intercepted

that child, Mr. Sullivan.



    

                   

Of course, without your help,

I never would have known



    

                   

that this went all the way up

to Waternoose.



    

                   

Now...



    

                   

about the girl...



    

                   

I just want to send her home.



    

                   

Very good.



    

                   

Bring me a door shredder.



    

                   

What, you mean... you mean,

I can't see her again?



    

                   

That's the way it has to be.



    

                   

I'll give you five minutes.



    

                   

Well, so long, kid.



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

Yeah.



    

                   

Ah, Boo, it's been fun.



    

                   

Go ahead.



    

                   

Go grow up.



    

                   

Uh-uh, B-Boo...?



    

                   

Um... Boo?



    

                   

Oh, look at that.



    

                   

Yeah, you know...



    

                   

Oh, that's cute, yeah.



    

                   

Uh, Boo, um...



    

                   

Well, that's very nice.



    

                   

Come here, you!



    

                   

Oh, he's a happy bear...



    

                   

Nothing's coming

out of your closet



    

                   

to scare you anymore, right?



    

                   

Mm...



    

                   

Yeah.



    

                   

Good-bye, Boo.



    

                   

Kitty.



    

                   

Kitty has to go.



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

Kitty?



    

                   

None of this



    

                   

ever happened, gentlemen.



    

                   

And I don't want to see

any paperwork on this.



    

                   

Take him away.



    

                   

I bet we get

the rest of the day off.



    

                   

You idiot!



    

                   

They're going to shut down

the factory!



    

                   

I'm telling you, pal,

when that wall went up



    

                   

you should have seen the look

on Waternoose's face.



    

                   

Whoo-hoo! I hope we get

a copy of that tape.



    

                   

Hey, you all right?



    

                   

Come on, pal,

cheer up, we did it!



    

                   

We got Boo home.



    

                   

Ah, sure, we put the factory

in the toilet, and...



    

                   

gee, hundreds of people

will be out of work now.



    

                   

Not to mention the angry mob

that'll come after us



    

                   

when there's no more power,

but, hey...



    

                   

at least we had

some laughs, right?



    

                   

Laughs...



    

                   

Hey, is this thing on? Hello?



    

                   

Hello? Testing, testing.



    

                   

Hey, good evening. How are you?



    

                   

How are you? Nice to see you.



    

                   

I tell you, it's good

to be here in... your room.



    

                   

Where you from?



    

                   

Never mind.



    

                   

You're in kindergarten, right?



    

                   

Oh, I love kindergarten.



    

                   

Best three years of my life.



    

                   

Of my life.



    

                   

But I love sports.



    

                   

Dodgeball was the best.



    

                   

Oh, yeah.



    

                   

I was the fastest one out there.



    

                   

Course I was the ball.



    

                   

But I...



    

                   

was the ball, see?



    

                   

All right.



    

                   

Ah...



    

                   

Ah?



    

                   

Hey, thanks a lot.



    

                   

I'll be here all week.



    

                   

Remember to tip your waitresses.



    

                   

Great job, Mikey.



    

                   

You filled your quota on

the first kid of the day.



    

                   

Not bad, huh?



    

                   

You know, only somebody

with perfect comedic timing



    

                   

could produce this much energy

in one shot.



    

                   

Uh-huh, and the fact

that laughter is



    

                   

ten times more

powerful than scream



    

                   

had nothing to do with it.



    

                   

Oh, Googley Bear.



    

                   

Come here, you.



    

                   

Schmoopsie-poo!



    

                   

Googley.



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

Girls!

Girls, put...



    

                   

Stop, stop, stop!



    

                   

Michael, you're such a charmer.



    

                   

Hey, did you bring the magazine?



    

                   

They just delivered a whole box.



    

                   

Let me see it!



    

                   

Sulley and I

made the cover, right?



    

                   

I don't believe it.



    

                   

Googley Bear...



    

                   

I'm on the cover of a magazine!



    

                   

Ow!



    

                   

Oh, this is great!



    

                   

Oh.



    

                   

Hey, Sulley!



    

                   

Hey, uh, Mike.

I was, uh, just...



    

                   

Well, listen,

if you got a minute



    

                   

there's something

I want to show you.



    

                   

But-but-but...



    

                   

Okay, close your eyes.



    

                   

Follow me. Come on.



    

                   

I-I-I...



    

                   

No peeking.



    

                   

Keep coming, keep coming,

keep coming.



    

                   

Come on, keep coming.



    

                   

Keep coming, keep coming.



    

                   

Mike...



    

                   

Follow the sultry

sound of my voice.



    

                   

Okay, stop.

Open them.



    

                   

Ta-da!



    

                   

Mike...



    

                   

Is that...?



    

                   

Sorry it took



    

                   

so long, pal.



    

                   

It was a lot of wood

to go through.



    

                   

You know, it only works



    

                   

if you have every piece.



    

                   

Boo?



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

- Speed.

- Marker.



    

                   

And... action.



    

                   

With a million or two



    

                   

I'd live in a penthouse



    

                   

In a room with a view



    

                   

And if I were handsome



    

                   

No way.



    

                   

It could happen.



    

                   

Those dreams do come true



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have you



    

                   

Wouldn't have nothing if I

didn't have



    

                   

Wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have



    

                   

Wouldn't have nothing...



    

                   

Okay, cut.



    

                   

Okay, you finished now, right?



    

                   

Hello?



    

                   

Hello.



    

                   

Come on, get lost, you two.



    

                   

You're making him lose

his focus.



    

                   

Oh, sorry.



    

                   

See you later, fellas.



    

                   

Go get 'em, Mr. Solomon.



    

                   

You idiot!



    

                   

It's Sullivan, not Solomon!



    

                   

What?



    

                   

You're messing up the scene!



    

                   

Sorry.



    

                   

We're never going to work

in Hollywood again!



    

                   

Let me do it over.



    

                   

Shut up!



    

                   

Keep rolling!



    

                   

You're making it worse!



    

                   

Duck and cover, people!



    

                   

Hey, thanks, guys.



    

                   

That was a close one.



    

                   

Ta-da!



    

                   

Oh, Boo, it's been fun.



    

                   

Go ahead.



    

                   

Go throw up.



    

                   

What? What did I say?



    

                   

What? What?



    

                   

Cut.



    

                   

Hey, Ted!



    

                   

Good morning!



    

                   

Cut.



    

                   

Hey, how was that? Was I scary?



    

                   

Do I get the part?



    

                   

Thank you.



    

                   

Can I do it again?



    

                   

I can be taller!



    

                   

Next!



    

                   

And action!



    

                   

Okay, let's move.

Let's move, let's move!



    

                   

Ow!



    

                   

Can we get a little more wax

on the floor, please?



    

                   

Wait a minute. Randall?



    

                   

That cheater!



    

                   

He's trying

to boost his numbers!



    

                   

There's something else.



    

                   

What?!



    

                   

Look-lay in the bag-bay.



    

                   

I think you mean

"Ook-lay in the ag-bay."



    

                   

What? Didn't I...?



    

                   

Well, you know, maybe

you should just take a minute



    

                   

and ead-ray your ipt-scray.



    

                   

You think he's going

to come through the closet



    

                   

and scare you.



    

                   

Oh, boy, how do I explain this?



    

                   

Uh, it's empty.



    

                   

See?



    

                   

Guess who.



    

                   

Hey, what's the...



    

                   

Okay, very funny.



    

                   

Hey, I look good in a suit.



    

                   

Marker.



    

                   

Let her rip.



    

                   

Go.



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

Shut it off! Shut it off!



    

                   

Pull the lever!



    

                   

You're making it worse!



    

                   

But I must admit it



    

                   

Big guy,

you always come through



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have you



    

                   

You and me together



    

                   

That's how it

always should be



    

                   

One without the other

don't mean nothing to me



    

                   

Nothing to me...



    

                   

Oh, hey!



    

                   

We're rehearsing a scene

for the upcoming company play



    

                   

called Put That Thing Back

Where It Came From



    

                   

Or So Help Me.



    

                   

It's a musical!

Bom-bom, bom-bom,

Get that thing

Or I'll poke myself

in the eye!



    

                   

It's a work in progress.



    

                   

It's gonna get better.



    

                   

Ladies and gentlemen

So help me



    

                   

I just gotta cry...



    

                   

Your seat is right

over there, sir.



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

There's a child,

there's a child



    

                   

There's a human child



    

                   

Oh, no!



    

                   

Running 'round

the restaurant



    

                   

This is really wild



    

                   

What in heaven's name

will become of us



    

                   

We who are living

in Monstropolis?



    

                   

All right, Wazowski.



    

                   

Tell us where the kid is.



    

                   

I will never talk!



    

                   

Never!



    

                   

She's out of our hair



    

                   

And just when I dare...

to care



    

                   

She says, "au contraire"



    

                   

You're my pair... of friends



    

                   

I love you.



    

                   

Keep it together, man!



    

                   

And so we put that kid

back where she came from



    

                   

And she helped us to find



    

                   

A better tomorrow today!



    

                   

Thank you!



    

                   

What a night for my mother

to be in the audience!



    

                   

Ladies and gentlemen



    

                   

my mom!



    

                   

Thank you, Monstropolis!



    

                   

I don't have to say it



    

                   

Ah, say it anyway.



    

                   

'Cause we...



    

                   

Both know it's true



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing if I

didn't have



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have you



    

                   

Wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have you.



    

                   

One more time.



    

                   

It worked!



    

                   

I don't have to say it



    

                   

I'm gonna anyway!



    

                   

'Cause we both know

it's true



    

                   

Let's take it home, big guy.



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing if I

didn't have



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have you



    

                   

You, you



    

                   

A, E, I, O...



    

                   

That means you, yeah.

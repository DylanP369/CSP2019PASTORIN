      <p><center>Bee Movie Script
      <p><center>According to all known laws
      of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- THAT GIRL WAS HOT.
- SHE'S MY COUSIN!

  
- SHE IS?
- YES, WE'RE ALL COUSINS.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"YOU LIKE JAZZ?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

  
But don't kill no more bugs!

  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The bees!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more bee beards!

  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our yogurt night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
Bees have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Bees must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?

  
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

  
You boys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase number 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using laser beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You mean like this?

  
Bears kill bees!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little bee!

  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing bees!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the bees

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke.

  
Right. Bees don't smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story about...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a bee smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what nature intended for us?

  
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
Free the bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
The court finds in favor of the bees!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could do it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You know what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
Barry, how much honey is out there?

  
All right. One at a time.

  
Barry, who are you wearing?

  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

  
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

  
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

  
every last drop.

  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

  
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

  
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

  
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Oan't breathe.

  
Bring it in, boys!

  
Hold it right there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

  
Shut down honey production!

  
Stop making honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What do we do now?

  
Oannonball!

  
We're shutting honey production!

  
Mission abort.

  
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

  
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's going on? Where is everybody?

  
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

  
At least we got our honey back.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I thought their lives would be better!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the half of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't look very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose fault do you think that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

  
Bees?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

  
That's our whole SAT test right there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's no more pollination,

  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

  
I know this is also partly my fault.

  
How about a suicide pact?

  
How do we do it?

  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

  
I had to open my mouth and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

  
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

  
I know. Me neither.

  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

  
Roses!

  
Vanessa!

  
Roses?!

  
Barry?

  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, bees, pollen!

  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

  
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

  
Oould you slow down?

  
Barry!

  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it kind of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

  
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

  
- Bees.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

  
Security will be tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

  
Official floral business. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

  
Thank you. It was a gift.

  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

  
How about The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

  
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

  
Let's see what this baby'll do.

  
Hey, what are you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

  
Would you remove your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

  
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

  
I think this is gonna work.

  
It's got to work.

  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

  
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

  
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

  
Be careful.

  
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

  
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

  
Bee!

  
Don't freak out! My entire species...

  
What are you doing?

  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, Barry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

  
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

  
And please hurry!

  
What happened here?

  
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

  
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

  
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

  
No one's flying the plane!

  
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

  
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

  
Where's the pilot?

  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

  
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

  
As a matter of fact, there is.

  
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

  
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

  
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

  
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

  
I can't fly a plane.

  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

  
How hard could it be?

  
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

  
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

  
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

  
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

  
That's Barry!

  
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

  
and an incapacitated flight crew.

  
Flowers?!

  
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

  
with absolutely no flight experience.

  
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

  
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

  
They've done enough damage.

  
But isn't he your only hope?

  
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

  
Their wings are too small...

  
Haven't we heard this a million times?

  
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

  
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

  
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

  
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

  
But let me tell you about a small job.

  
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

  
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

  
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

  
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

  
We get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

  
Left, right, down, hover.

  
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

  
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

  
Barry, what happened?!

  
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

  
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

  
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

  
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

  
Move out!

  
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

  
Don't have to yell.

  
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

  
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

  
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

  
I can't do this!

  
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

  
You snap out of it.

  
You snap out of it.

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

  
How is the plane flying?

  
I don't know.

  
Hello?

  
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

  
The Pollen Jocks!

  
They do get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

  
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

  
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

  
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

  
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

  
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

  
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

  
Bring the nose down.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

  
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

  
Affirmative!

  
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

  
Land on that flower!

  
Ready? Full reverse!

  
Spin it around!

  
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

  
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

  
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

  
made of millions of bees!

  
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

  
Rotate around it.

  
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

  
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

  
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

  
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

  
Aim for the center!

  
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

  
Oome on, already.

  
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

  
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

  
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

  
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

  
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

  
Listen, everyone!

  
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

  
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

  
That means this is our last chance.

  
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

  
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

  
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

  
We're bees!

  
Keychain!

  
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

  
Hold on, Barry. Here.

  
You've earned this.

  
Yeah!

  
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

  
Oh, yeah.

  
That's our Barry.

  
Mom! The bees are back!

  
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

  
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

  
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

  
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

  
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

  
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

  
I had no idea.

  
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

  
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

  
Sorry I'm late.

  
He's a lawyer too?

  
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

  
Have a great afternoon!

  
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

  
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

  
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

  
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

  
Thank you, Barry!

  
That bee is living my life!

  
Let it go, Kenny.

  
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

  
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

  
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

  
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

  
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

  
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

  
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

  
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

  
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

          <p><center>Monsters Inc. Script

All right,

Mr. Bile, is it?



  

                   

Uh... my friends

call me Phlegm.



  

                   

Uh-huh.



  

                   

Mr. Bile, can you tell me

what you did wrong?



  

                   

I fell down?



  

                   

No, no, before that.



  

                   

Can anyone tell me

Mr. Bile's big mistake?



  

                   

Anyone?



  

                   

Let's take a look

at the tape.



  

                   

Here we go.



  

                   

Uh, right...

puh-puh-puh-puh...



  

                   

Ah! There, see?



  

                   

The door.

You left it wide open.



  

                   

And leaving the door open

is the worst mistake



  

                   

any employee can make

because...?



  

                   

Um... it could let in a draft?



  

                   

It could let in



  

                   

a child!



  

                   

Oh! Mr. Waternoose!



  

                   

There is nothing more toxic

or deadly than a human child.



  

                   

A single touch could kill you!



  

                   

Leave a door open



  

                   

and a child could walk

right into this factory!



  

                   

Right into the monster world!



  

                   

I won't go in a kid's room!



  

                   

You can't make me!



  

                   

You're going in there

because we need this.



  

                   

Our city is counting on you



  

                   

to collect

those children's screams.



  

                   

Without scream,

we have no power.



  

                   

Yes, it's dangerous work



  

                   

and that's why I need

you to be at your best.



  

                   

I need scarers who are

confident, tenacious



  

                   

tough, intimidating.



  

                   

I need scarers like... like...

James P. Sullivan.



  

                   

Hey! Good morning,

Monstropolis.



  

                   

It's now five after

In the big monster city.



  

                   

Temperature's

a balmy    degrees...



  

                   

which is good news

for you reptiles...



  

                   

and it looks like

it's going to be a perfect day



  

                   

to maybe, hey,

just lie in bed, sleep in



  

                   

or simply... work out that flab

that's hanging over the bed!



  

                   

Get up, Sulley!



  

                   

I don't believe I ordered

a wake-up call, Mikey.



  

                   

Hey! Less talk, more pain,

marshmallow boy!



  

                   

Feel the burn!



  

                   

You call yourself a monster?



  

                   

Scary feet, scary feet,

scary feet!



  

                   

Oop! The kid's awake!



  

                   

Okay, scary feet, scary feet,

scary feet, scary feet...



  

                   

kid's asleep!



  

                   

Twins! In a bunk bed!



  

                   

Ooh! I thought I had you there.



  

                   

Okay, Sulley, here we go.



  

                   

You ready? Follow it.



  

                   

Oh! It's over here!



  

                   

Oh, look over there!



  

                   

Don't let the kid touch you!



  

                   

Don't let it touch you!



  

                   

I don't know,

but it's been said



  

                   

I love scaring kids in bed!



  

                   

Come on, fight that plaque!

Fight that plaque!



  

                   

Scary monsters

don't have plaque!



  

                   

   ... do you have    ?



  

                   

Do I see    ?



  

                   

Oh, I don't believe it!



  

                   

I'm not even

breaking a sweat.



  

                   

Not you!



  

                   

Look! The new commercial's on!



  

                   

The future is bright

at Monsters, Incorporated.



  

                   

I'm in this one!

I'm in this one!



  

                   

We're part of your life.



  

                   

We power your car.



  

                   

We warm your home.



  

                   

We light your city.



  

                   

I'm Monsters, Incorporated.



  

                   

Hey, look! Betty!



  

                   

Carefully matching every child

to their ideal monster...



  

                   

to produce superior scream



  

                   

refined into clean,

dependable energy.



  

                   

Every time you turn something on



  

                   

Monsters, Incorporated,

is there.



  

                   

I'm Monsters, Incorporated!



  

                   

We know the challenge...



  

                   

the window of innocence

is shrinking.



  

                   

Human kids are harder to scare.



  

                   

Of course, M.I. Is prepared

for the future



  

                   

with the top scarers...



  

                   

the best refineries



   

                   

and research

into new energy techniques.



   

                   

Okay, here I come.



   

                   

We're working for

a better tomorrow... today!



   

                   

We're Monsters, Incorporated!



   

                   

We're M. I...

Monsters, Incorporated.



   

                   

We scare because we care.



   

                   

I can't believe it.



   

                   

Oh, Mike...



   

                   

I was on TV!



   

                   

Did you see me? I'm a natural!



   

                   

Hello.



   

                   

I know!



   

                   

Hey, wasn't I great?



   

                   

Did the whole family see it?



   

                   

It's your mom.



   

                   

What can I say?

The camera loves me.



   

                   

I'm telling you, big daddy



   

                   

you're going to be seeing this

face on TV a lot more often.



   

                   

Yeah? Like, on

Monstropolis's Most Wanted?



   

                   

You've been jealous

of my good looks



   

                   

since the fourth grade, pal.



   

                   

Have a good day, sweetie.



   

                   

You, too, hon.



   

                   

Whoo!

Okay, Sulley, hop on in.



   

                   

Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.



   

                   

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!



   

                   

Where you going?

What are you doing?



   

                   

Mikey, there's a scream

shortage. We're walking.



   

                   

- Walking?!

- Yep.



   

                   

No, no, no, my baby.



   

                   

Come on. Come on.



   

                   

Look, she needs to be driven.



   

                   

Bye, baby.

I... I'll call you!



   

                   

Hey, genius,

you want to know why



   

                   

I bought the car? Huh?



   

                   

Not really.



   

                   

To drive it!



   

                   

You know, like, on the street?



   

                   

With the honk-honk

and the vroom-vroom



   

                   

and no walking involved.



   

                   

Give it a rest,

will you, butterball?



   

                   

Come on, you could

use the exercise.



   

                   

I could use the exercise?!



   

                   

Look at you.

You have your own climate!



   

                   

How many tentacles

jump the rope?



   

                   

Morning, Mike!

Morning, Sulley!



   

                   

Hey! Morning, kids.



   

                   

Hey, kids.



   

                   

How you doing?



   

                   

Bye, Mike! Bye, Sulley!



   

                   

Ow! Hey!



   

                   

Ah, nuts.



   

                   

Hey, hey, hey! Fellas!



   

                   

Hey, Tony!



   

                   

Tony! Ba-da-bing!



   

                   

- Tony!

- Hey, Tony!



   

                   

Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow!



   

                   

I hear somebody's close

to breaking



   

                   

the all-time scare record.



   

                   

Ah, just trying

to make sure



   

                   

there's enough scream

to go around.



   

                   

Hey! On the house!



   

                   

- Hey, thanks!

- Grazie!



   

                   

Ba-da-bing!



   

                   

Oh, great.



   

                   

Hey, Ted!



   

                   

Good morning!



   

                   

See that, Mikey?



   

                   

Ted's walking to work.



   

                   

Big deal.



   

                   

Guy takes five steps

and he's there.

Morning, Sulley.



   

                   

Morning, Ricky.



   

                   

Hey, it's the Sullster!



   

                   

See you on the scare floor,

buddy!



   

                   

Hey, Marge.

Hey, how was jury duty?



   

                   

Morning, Sulley!



   

                   

Hey!



   

                   

Hey, it's still leaning

to the left.



   

                   

It is not!



   

                   

Hey, fellas.



   

                   

Hey, Jerry.



   

                   

Hey, Mr. Sullivan!



   

                   

Guys, I told you,

call me Sulley.



   

                   

I don't think so.



   

                   

We just wanted to wish you

good luck today.



   

                   

Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!



   

                   

Come on, get lost, you two.



   

                   

You're making him lose

his focus.



   

                   

Oh. Sorry.



   

                   

See you later, fellas.



   

                   

Go get 'em, Mr. Sullivan!



   

                   

Quiet! You'll make him lose

his focus.



   

                   

Oh, no. Sorry!



   

                   

Shut up!



   

                   

Monsters, Inc. Please hold.



   

                   

Monsters, Inc.

I'll connect you.



   

                   

Ms. Fearmonger is on vacation.



   

                   

Would you like her voice mail?



   

                   

Oh, Schmoopsie-poo.



   

                   

Googley Bear!



   

                   

Happy birthday.



   

                   

Oh, Googley-woogley,

you remembered!



   

                   

Hey, Sulley-wulley.



   

                   

Oh, hey, Celia...



   

                   

weelia.



   

                   

Happy birthday.



   

                   

Thanks.



   

                   

So, uh... are we going

anywhere special tonight?



   

                   

I just got us

into a little place



   

                   

called, um... Harryhausen's.



   

                   

Harryhausen's?!



   

                   

But it's impossible to

get a reservation there!



   

                   

Not for Googley Bear.



   

                   

I will see you

at quitting time



   

                   

and not a minute later.



   

                   

Okay, sweetheart.



   

                   

Think romantical thoughts.



   

                   

You and me



   

                   

Me and you



   

                   

Both of us together!



   

                   

You know, pal, she's the one.



   

                   

That's it. She is the one!



   

                   

I'm happy for you.



   

                   

Oh, and, uh,

thanks for hooking me up



   

                   

with those reservations.



   

                   

Oh, no problem.



   

                   

They're under the name

Googley Bear.



   

                   

Oh, good ide...



   

                   

You know,

that wasn't very funny.



   

                   

What the...?



   

                   

Wazowski!



   

                   

What do you know?



   

                   

It scares little kids

and little monsters.



   

                   

I wasn't scared.



   

                   

I have... allergies.



   

                   

Uh-huh. Sure.



   

                   

Hey, Randall, save it for

the scare floor, will you?



   

                   

I'm in the zone today,

Sullivan.



   

                   

Going to be doing

some serious scaring.



   

                   

Putting up some big numbers.



   

                   

Wow, Randall.



   

                   

That's great.



   

                   

That should make it

even more humiliating



   

                   

when we break the record first.



   

                   

Ha, ha!



   

                   

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.



   

                   

Do you hear that?



   

                   

It's the winds of change.



   

                   

"You hear it? You hear

the winds of ch...?"



   

                   

Oh, what a creep.



   

                   

One of these days,

I am really...



   

                   

going to let you

teach that guy a lesson.



   

                   

Chalooby! Baby!



   

                   

Good morning, Roz



   

                   

my succulent

little garden snail.



   

                   

And who would

we be scaring today?



   

                   

Wazowski, you didn't file

your paperwork last night.



   

                   

Oh, that darn paperwork.



   

                   

Wouldn't it be easier

if it all just blew away?



   

                   

Don't let it happen again.



   

                   

Yes, well, I'll, uh...



   

                   

I'll try to be less careless.



   

                   

I'm watching you, Wazowski.



   

                   

Always watching.



   

                   

Whoo! She's nuts.



   

                   

Always!



   

                   

All scare floors are now active.



   

                   

Assistants, please report

to your stations.



   

                   

Okay, people, eastern seaboard

coming on-line.



   

                   

We got scarers coming out!



   

                   

Ooh, they're

so awesome.



   

                   

Hey... may the best monster win.



   

                   

I plan to.



   

                   

We are on in seven... six...



   

                   

five... four... three...



   

                   

two...



   

                   

You're the boss.

You're the boss.



   

                   

You're the big, hairy boss.



   

                   

Oh, I'm feeling good today,

Mikey!



   

                   

Yeah!



   

                   

Whoa!



   

                   

Attaboy.

Attaboy.



   

                   

Another door coming right up.



   

                   

You're still behind,

Randall.



   

                   

You know, maybe I should realign

the scream intake valve.



   

                   

Just get me another door!



   

                   

A door! Yes, door!



   

                   

Well, Jerry,

what's the damage so far?



   

                   

We may actually

make our quota today, sir.



   

                   

Hmm. First time in a month.



   

                   

Huh?!



   

                   

What happened?



   

                   

The kid almost touched me!



   

                   

She got this close to me!



   

                   

She wasn't scared of you?



   

                   

She was only six!



   

                   

I could've been dead!



   

                   

I could've died!



   

                   

Keep it together, man.



   

                   

Hey! We got a dead door

over here!



   

                   

- We're coming!

- Coming!



   

                   

- Look out!

- Out of the way!



   

                   

- Coming through!

- Excuse us.



   

                   

We've lost    doors

this week, sir.



   

                   

Oh, kids these days.



   

                   

They just don't get

scared like they used to.



   

                   

Let her rip!



   

                   

Uh, sir?



   

                   

What?!



   

                   

Look.



   

                   

Attention.



   

                   

We have a new scare leader:

Randall Boggs.



   

                   

Slumber party.



   

                   

Whoo!



   

                   

Never mind.



   

                   

Hey! Watch it!



   

                   

Well, James, that was

an impressive display!



   

                   

Oh, just doing my job,

Mr. Waternoose.



   

                   

Of course, I did learn

from the best.



   

                   

If I don't see a new door

at my station in five seconds



   

                   

I will personally put you

through the shredder!



   

                   

Hey, Wazowski, nice job!



   

                   

Those numbers are pretty sweet.



   

                   

Are they?



   

                   

You know,

I hadn't even noticed.



   

                   

And, uh...

how is Georgie doing?



   

                   

He's doing great!



   

                   

I love working

with that big guy.



   

                   

Keep the doors coming,

Charlie.



   

                   

I'm on a roll today.



   

                   

George and I

are like brothers.



   

                   

    ! We have a     !



   

                   

Red alert! Red alert!



   

                   

Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!



   

                   

George Sanderson



   

                   

please remain motionless.



   

                   

Prepare for decontamination.



   

                   

Get it off!



   

                   

Duck and cover, people!



   

                   

Oh, not the CDA.



   

                   

Move! Move! Move!



   

                   

Coming through, please.

Stand aside.



   

                   

Clear the contaminated area.



   

                   

This is a      in progress.



   

                   

Keep the area clear.



   

                   

Coming through. Watch yourself.



   

                   

Stand back.



   

                   

Careful.



   

                   

All clear.



   

                   

Situation is niner-niner-zero.



   

                   

Ready for decon.



   

                   

Hey, thanks, guys.



   

                   

That was a close one.



   

                   

Okay.



   

                   

Okay, people, take a break!



   

                   

We got to shut down

for a half-hour



   

                   

and reset the system.



   

                   

An entire scare floor

out of commission.



   

                   

What else can go wrong?



   

                   

Oh... what a day.



   

                   

We're just going through

a rough time, sir.



   

                   

Everyone knows you're going

to get us through it.



   

                   

Tell that

to the board of directors.



   

                   

James, this company



   

                   

has been in my family

for three generations.



   

                   

I would do anything

to keep it from going under.



   

                   

Oh, so would I, sir.



   

                   

Well...



   

                   

Say, I could use your help

with something.



   

                   

Anything, sir.



   

                   

You see, we've hired

some new scare recruits



   

                   

and frankly, they're...

they're, um... uh...



   

                   

Inexperienced?



   

                   

Oh, they stink!



   

                   

Uh-huh.



   

                   

And I thought maybe

you might come by tomorrow



   

                   

and give them a demonstration.



   

                   

Show them what it takes

to be a top scarer, huh?



   

                   

I'll start out with the old

Waternoose jump-and-growl.



   

                   

Ha! Oh, oh, yes!



   

                   

Now, that's my boy!



   

                   

Let's go, everybody!



   

                   

All doors must be returned!



   

                   

No exceptions!



   

                   

- Oh, yeah.

- Whoo!



   

                   

I've never seen anything

like you today.



   

                   

You were on a roll, my man.



   

                   

Another day like this



   

                   

and that scare record's

in the bag.



   

                   

That's right, baby!



   

                   

Uh-huh.



   

                   

So get this...

as if dinner wasn't enough



   

                   

I'm taking her to a monster

truck rally afterwards.



   

                   

Nice.



   

                   

What's on your agenda?



   

                   

I'm going to head home

and work out some more.



   

                   

Again? You know, there's

more to life than scaring.



   

                   

Whew. Hey, can I

borrow your odorant?



   

                   

Yeah. I got, uh...



   

                   

smelly garbage or old dumpster.



   

                   

You got low tide?



   

                   

No.



   

                   

How about wet dog?



   

                   

Yep. Stink it up.



   

                   

You know, I am so romantic



   

                   

sometimes I think

I should just marry myself.



   

                   

Give me a break, Mike.



   

                   

What a night of romance

I got ahead of me.



   

                   

Tonight is about me



   

                   

and Celia.



   

                   

Ooh, the love boat

is about to set sail.



   

                   

'Cause I got

to tell you, buddy



   

                   

that face of hers,

it just makes my heart go...



   

                   

Yikes!



   

                   

Hello, Wazowski.



   

                   

Fun-filled evening

planned for tonight?



   

                   

Well, as a matter of fact...



   

                   

Then I'm sure you

filed your paperwork



   

                   

correctly... for once.



   

                   

Your stunned silence

is very reassuring.



   

                   

Oh, no. My scare reports...

I left them on my desk



   

                   

and if I'm not at the restaurant

in five minutes



   

                   

they're going to give

our table away!



   

                   

What am I going to tell...



   

                   

Schmoopsie-poo?



   

                   

Hey, Googley Bear.

Want to get going?



   

                   

Do I ever!

It's just that...



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Uh, you know,

there's a small...



   

                   

I don't understand.



   

                   

It's just that I forgot

about some paperwork



   

                   

I was supposed to file.



   

                   

Mike was reminding me.



   

                   

Thanks, buddy.



   

                   

Whoo.



   

                   

I was? I mean, I was!

Yeah, I was.



   

                   

Oh, okay. Let's go then.



   

                   

We're going!



   

                   

On my desk, Sulley.



   

                   

The pink copies

go to Accounting



   

                   

the fuchsia ones

go to Purchasing



   

                   

and goldenrod ones

go to Roz.



   

                   

Huh!



   

                   

Leave the puce.



   

                   

Pink copies go to Accounting,

the fuchsia ones go to Roz.



   

                   

No, the fuchsia ones

go to Purchasing.



   

                   

The goldenrod ones go to Roz.



   

                   

Man, I have no idea

what puce is.



   

                   

Oh, that's puce.



   

                   

Hmm?



   

                   

Uh, hello?



   

                   

Anyone?



   

                   

There's a door here.



   

                   

Hmm.



   

                   

Hello?



   

                   

Hey.



   

                   

Psst.



   

                   

Anybody scaring in here?



   

                   

Hello?



   

                   

Yo!



   

                   

Hmm.



   

                   

Whoa! Ah! Ah!



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

Here.



   

                   

Gotcha!



   

                   

Eh!



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

Yeow!



   

                   

Eww.



   

                   

Whew.



   

                   

Kitty!



   

                   

No, no... stay back.



   

                   

Hmm.



   

                   

And hold it.



   

                   

Get a paper bag!



   

                   

Mmm.



   

                   

Oh, Michael, I've had

a lot of birthday...



   

                   

well, not a lot of birthdays



   

                   

but this is

the best birthday ever.



   

                   

Hmm.



   

                   

What are you looking at?



   

                   

I was just thinking



   

                   

about the first time

I laid eye on you...



   

                   

how pretty you looked.



   

                   

Stop it!



   

                   

Your hair was

shorter then.



   

                   

Mm-hmm. I'm thinking

about getting it cut.



   

                   

No, no, I like

it this length.



   

                   

I like everything about you.



   

                   

Just the other day



   

                   

someone asked me who I thought



   

                   

the most beautiful monster was

in all of Monstropolis.



   

                   

You know what I said?



   

                   

What did you say?



   

                   

I said...



   

                   

- Sulley?

- Sulley?



   

                   

No! No, no.



   

                   

That's not

what I was going to say.



   

                   

Mike, you're not making sense.



   

                   

Hi, guys!



   

                   

What a coincidence,

running into you here!



   

                   

Uh, I'm just going

to order something to go.



   

                   

Michael...



   

                   

Sulley!



   

                   

I wonder what's good here.



   

                   

Get out of here.

You're ruining everything.



   

                   

I went back to get

your paperwork



   

                   

and there was a door.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

A door?!



   

                   

Randall was in it.



   

                   

Wait a minute. Randall?



   

                   

That cheater!



   

                   

He's trying

to boost his numbers!



   

                   

There's something else.



   

                   

What?!



   

                   

Ook-lay in the ag-bay.



   

                   

What?!



   

                   

Look in the bag.



   

                   

What bag?



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

They don't have

anything I like here.



   

                   

So take care, Celia!



   

                   

Excuse me, sir.



   

                   

What's going on?



   

                   

Celia, please try

to understand.



   

                   

I have to do something!



   

                   

Michael?



   

                   

On three.



   

                   

One... two...



   

                   

A kid!



   

                   

Boo!



   

                   

A kid!



   

                   

There's a kid here...

a human kid!



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

Googley Bear!



   

                   

Come on!



   

                   

Let's get out of here!



   

                   

Please remain calm.



   

                   

This is not a drill.



   

                   

We have an     in progress.



   

                   

Please advise.



   

                   

Michael? Michael?



   

                   

Oh, Celia.



   

                   

- Please come with me.

- Ow. Stop pushing.



   

                   

Hey, get your hands off

my Schmoopsie-poo!



   

                   

Building clear.

Ready for decontamination.



   

                   

Well, I don't think that date

could have gone any worse.



   

                   

If witnesses are to be believed



   

                   

there has been

a child security breach



   

                   

for the first time

in monster history.



   

                   

We can neither confirm nor deny



   

                   

the presence of a human child

here tonight.



   

                   

Well, a kid flew right over me



   

                   

and blasted a car

with its laser vision!



   

                   

I tried to run from it,

but it picked me up



   

                   

with its mind powers

and shook me like a doll!



   

                   

It's true!

I saw the whole thing!



   

                   

It is my

professional opinion



   

                   

that now is the time

to... panic!



   

                   

Oh-oh.



   

                   

Oh, it's coming!



   

                   

It's coming!



   

                   

Boo!



   

                   

No, no, no, no, no!



   

                   

Come here, kid.



   

                   

Whee.



   

                   

No, don't touch those,

you little...!



   

                   

Oh, now



   

                   

those were alphabetized.



   

                   

It's okay, it's all right.



   

                   

As long as it doesn't

come near us



   

                   

we're going to be okay.



   

                   

Wanna ride on it!



   

                   

Da, da-da.



   

                   

Da-da-da.



   

                   

Oh, y-you like this?



   

                   

Fetch!



   

                   

Hey, hey, that's it!



   

                   

No one touches little Mikey!



   

                   

Mike, give her the bear.



   

                   

Oh, no.



   

                   

Make it stop, Sulley!



   

                   

Make it stop!



   

                   

Look! See the bear?



   

                   

Ooh, nice bear.



   

                   

Sulley!



   

                   

See?



   

                   

Ooh, bear, ooh.



   

                   

Oh, he's

a happy bear.



   

                   

He's not crying,

neither should you



   

                   

Or we'll be in trouble



   

                   

'Cause they're gonna find us



   

                   

So please stop crying



   

                   

Right now.



   

                   

Good, good, Sulley.

Keep it up.



   

                   

You're doing great.



   

                   

Ooh, the happy bear,

he has no...



   

                   

She touched me!



   

                   

Sulley, the bear!



   

                   

The bear!



   

                   

Give her the...



   

                   

Whoa!



   

                   

What was that?



   

                   

I have no idea



   

                   

but it would be really great



   

                   

if it didn't do it again.



   

                   

Shh, shh, shh.



   

                   

Shh...



   

                   

Shh.



   

                   

Shh...



   

                   

Ah!



   

                   

How could I do this?



   

                   

How could I be so stupid?



   

                   

This could destroy the company.



   

                   

The company?



   

                   

Who cares about the company?!



   

                   

What about us?



   

                   

That thing is

a killing machine!



   

                   

La-la-la-la-la-la



   

                   

I bet it's just waiting

for us to fall asleep



   

                   

and then wham!



   

                   

Oh, we're easy prey,

my friend... easy prey.



   

                   

We're sitting targets.



   

                   

Okay, look, I think



   

                   

I have a plan here.



   

                   

Using mainly spoons, we dig

a tunnel under the city



   

                   

and release it into the wild.



   

                   

Spoons.



   

                   

That's it, I'm out of ideas.



   

                   

We're closed.

Hot air balloon?



   

                   

Too expensive.

Giant slingshot?



   

                   

Too conspicuous.



   

                   

Enormous wooden horse?

Too Greek!



   

                   

No plan. No plan.



   

                   

Can't think. Can't think.



   

                   

Flatlining.



   

                   

Uh, Mike?



   

                   

I think she's getting tired.



   

                   

Well, then

why don't you



   

                   

find someplace

for it to sleep?



   

                   

While I think of a plan!



   

                   

Are you sleepy?



   

                   

You want to sleep?



   

                   

Is that what you want?



   

                   

Huh?



   

                   

Okay, all right.



   

                   

I'm making a nice little area

for you to...



   

                   

No. Hey, hey, that's my bed!



   

                   

You're going to get

your germs all over it.



   

                   

Fine.



   

                   

My chair is

more comfortable anyway.



   

                   

What?



   

                   

It's just a closet.



   

                   

Will you go to sleep?



   

                   

Hey, that looks like Randall.



   

                   

Randall's your monster.



   

                   

You think he's going

to come through the closet



   

                   

and scare you.



   

                   

Oh, boy, how do I explain this?



   

                   

Uh, it's empty.



   

                   

- See?

- Ah!



   

                   

No monster in here.



   

                   

Well, now there is



   

                   

but I'm not going to scare you.



   

                   

I'm off-duty.



   

                   

Okay.



   

                   

How about I sit here,

until you fall asleep?



   

                   

Go ahead.



   

                   

Go to sleep.



   

                   

Now.



   

                   

Now... go.



   

                   

Uh, you...



   

                   

go...



   

                   

to...



   

                   

sleep.



   

                   

Hey, Mike,

this might sound crazy



   

                   

but I don't think

that kid's dangerous.



   

                   

Really? Well, in that case,

let's keep it.



   

                   

I always wanted a pet

that could kill me!



   

                   

Now, look.



   

                   

What if we just put

her back in her door?



   

                   

What?



   

                   

Mike, think about it.



   

                   

If we send her back,

it's like it never happened.



   

                   

Everything goes back to normal.



   

                   

Is that a joke?



   

                   

Tell me you're joking.



   

                   

Sulley, I'd like to think

that, given the circumstances



   

                   

I have been extremely

forgiving up to now



   

                   

but that is a horrible idea!



   

                   

What are we going to do?



   

                   

March right out into

public with that thing?



   

                   

Then I guess we just waltz

right up to the factory, right?



   

                   

I can't believe we are waltzing

right up to the factory.



   

                   

Sulley, a mop, a couple of

lights and some chair fabric



   

                   

are not going

to fool anyone!



   

                   

Just think about

a few names, will you?



   

                   

Loch Ness, Bigfoot,

the Abominable Snowman...



   

                   

they all got one thing

in common, pal... banishment.



   

                   

We could be next!



   

                   

Don't panic...

we can do this.



   

                   

Hey, how you doing, Frank?



   

                   

Hey, guys.



   

                   

Everything's going



   

                   

to be okay.



   

                   

Number One wants this place

dusted for prints.



   

                   

Careful with that.



   

                   

I got a good view from here.



   

                   

A little lower.



   

                   

This was recovered

at the scene.



   

                   

Don't panic. Don't panic!



   

                   

Don't tell me not to panic.



   

                   

Just keep it together.



   

                   

Everything is not okay!



   

                   

Boo.



   

                   

...could be contaminated.



   

                   

Gentlemen, safety



   

                   

is our number one concern.



   

                   

If there's anything that...



   

                   

not now, not now.



   

                   

Oh, hello, little one.



   

                   

Where did you come from?



   

                   

Mr. Waternoose!



   

                   

Ah, James!

Is this one yours?



   

                   

Actually, that's my, uh,

cousin's sister's daughter, sir.



   

                   

Yeah, it's, uh...



   

                   

"Bring an Obscure

Relative to Work Day."



   

                   

Hmm, must have missed the memo.



   

                   

Well, listen, James



   

                   

why don't you stop by

the simulator after lunch today



   

                   

and give us

that scare demonstration



   

                   

we talked about, huh?



   

                   

Oh, oh, sir, uh...



   

                   

Excuse me,

Mr. Waternoose?



   

                   

Yes, yes, I'm coming.



   

                   

All right then, I'll see

you this afternoon, James.



   

                   

That is, if these gentlemen

haven't shut us down.



   

                   

Oh, boy.



   

                   

Oh, a scare demo.



   

                   

Well, that is great.



   

                   

Why am I

the last to know?



   

                   

We can bring your cousin's

sister's daughter along.



   

                   

She'll be a big hit!



   

                   

Halt!



   

                   

Stop him!



   

                   

Hold him down.



   

                   

Come on, the coast is clear.



   

                   

Okay, all we have to do

is get rid of that thing.



   

                   

So, wait here while

I get its card key.



   

                   

But she can't stay here.



   

                   

This is the men's room.



   

                   

That is the weirdest thing

you have ever said.



   

                   

It's fine. It's okay.



   

                   

Look, it loves it here!



   

                   

It's dancing with joy!



   

                   

Uh, uh, uh, uh.



   

                   

I'll be right back

with its door key.



   

                   

That's a cute little

dance you've got.



   

                   

It almost looks

like you've got to...



   

                   

Oh.



   

                   

Uh, are you done in there?



   

                   

Ah! Sorry. Sorry.



   

                   

Okay, you

finished now, right?



   

                   

Hello?



   

                   

Boo.



   

                   

Where did she go?



   

                   

Oh, did she disappear?



   

                   

Did she turn invisible?



   

                   

I just have no idea.



   

                   

Gotcha!



   

                   

Boo.



   

                   

Hey, you're good.



   

                   

Be relaxed,

be relaxed, be relaxed.



   

                   

Roz, my tender, oozing blossom



   

                   

you're looking fabulous today.



   

                   

Is that a new haircut?



   

                   

Come on, tell me.



   

                   

It's a new haircut, isn't it?



   

                   

That's got to be a new haircut.



   

                   

New makeup? You've had a lift.



   

                   

You've had a tuck.

You've had something.



   

                   

Something has been

inserted in your skin



   

                   

that makes you look like...



   

                   

Listen, I need a favor.



   

                   

Randall was working

late last night



   

                   

out on the scare floor.



   

                   

I really need the key

for the door he was using.



   

                   

Well, isn't that nice?



   

                   

But guess what?



   

                   

You didn't turn in

your paperwork last night.



   

                   

He didn't... I... no paperwork?



   

                   

This office is now closed.



   

                   

Ready or not, here I come!



   

                   

I'm getting warmer.



   

                   

Any second now.



   

                   

Fee fi fo...



   

                   

What are you doing?!



   

                   

L-I'm looking for the kid.



   

                   

You lost it?!



   

                   

No, no, she was just...



   

                   

Here she is.



   

                   

Hey, what's the matter?



   

                   

I already told your buddies

I haven't seen anything.



   

                   

All right, carry on.



   

                   

Randall!

Thank goodness!



   

                   

What are we going to do

about the child?



   

                   

Shh!



   

                   

Shh, shh, shh.



   

                   

The front page!

It's on the front page.



   

                   

The child...

the one you were after.



   

                   

Will you be quiet?!



   

                   

Don't you think I'm aware

of the situation?



   

                   

I was up all night

trying to find it.



   

                   

I did a simple

calculation



   

                   

factoring in the size

of the sushi restaurant.



   

                   

The child may have escaped!



   

                   

Yeah, well, until

we know for sure



   

                   

we're going to act like nothing

happened, understand?



   

                   

You just get the machine

up and running.



   

                   

I'll take care of the kid.



   

                   

And when I find whoever

let it out, they're dead!



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

Why are you still here?



   

                   

Come on, go!



   

                   

Move! Now!



   

                   

Ow, ow! I'm not here.



   

                   

They're gone.



   

                   

Eww.



   

                   

This is bad.

This is so very bad.



   

                   

What were they talking

about a machine?



   

                   

Who cares? Oh!



   

                   

Look, don't panic...

all we have to do



   

                   

is call her door down

and send her home.



   

                   

You're right, you're right.



   

                   

We're just two regular joes

on our way to work.



   

                   

We will blend right in.



   

                   

Top of the mornin', fellas!



   

                   

Hey, what's shakin', bacon?



   

                   

Did you lose weight?



   

                   

Or a limb?



   

                   

You have her card key, right?



   

                   

Of course

I have her card key.



   

                   

I told you

I'd get her card key.



   

                   

I went and got her card key



   

                   

and now I have her card key.



   

                   

Okay, here we go.



   

                   

Take care of yourself.



   

                   

Try not to run

through any more closets.



   

                   

Mike, that's not her door.



   

                   

What are you talking about?



   

                   

Of course it's her door.

It's her door.



   

                   

No, her door was white

and it had flowers on it.



   

                   

No. It must have been

dark last night



   

                   

because this is its door.



   

                   

Hey, you hear that?



   

                   

Sounds like

fun in there!



   

                   

Okay, send me a postcard, kid.



   

                   

That's Mike Wazowski, care of



   

                   

   Mike-Wazowski-

you-got-your-life-back Lane.



   

                   

Mowki Kowski.



   

                   

Very good. Now bon voyage!



   

                   

Bye-bye!

Come on.



   

                   

Look at the stick.

See the stick?



   

                   

Go get the stick! Go fetch.



   

                   

Mike, this isn't Boo's door.



   

                   

Boo? What's Boo?



   

                   

That's what I decided

to call her.



   

                   

Is there a problem?



   

                   

Sulley, you're not

supposed to name it.



   

                   

Once you name it, you start

getting attached to it!



   

                   

Now put that thing



   

                   

back where it came from,

or so help me...



   

                   

Oh, hey!



   

                   

We're rehearsing a scene

for the upcoming company play



   

                   

called Put That Thing

Back Where It Came From



   

                   

Or So Help Me.



   

                   

It's a musical!



   

                   

Put that thing back where

it came from or so help me



   

                   

Bom-bom, bom-bom,

bom-bom...



   

                   

So help me, so help me.



   

                   

And cut!



   

                   

We're still working on it.



   

                   

It's a work in progress



   

                   

but, hey, we need ushers.



   

                   

Sulley, I've had enough.



   

                   

Now say good-bye to...

where'd it go?



   

                   

What'd you do with it?



   

                   

Where is she?



   

                   

I don't believe it.



   

                   

She got away from you again?!



   

                   

Well, that is just...



   

                   

Wait a minute.



   

                   

The sun is coming up.



   

                   

This is perfect!



   

                   

She's gone!



   

                   

Hey, hey, hey, hey.



   

                   

Where are you going?



   

                   

Sulley, please,

don't blow this.



   

                   

Not when we're so close

to breaking the record.



   

                   

Somebody else

will find the kid.



   

                   

It'll be their problem,

not ours!



   

                   

She's out of our hair!



   

                   

What are you two doing?



   

                   

They're rehearsing a play.



   

                   

She's out of our hair!



   

                   

Can it, Wazowski!



   

                   

So, what do you think of that

kid getting out, Sullivan?



   

                   

Pretty crazy, huh?



   

                   

Oh, yeah, crazy.



   

                   

Word on the street is the kid's



   

                   

been traced back

to this factory.



   

                   

You haven't seen anything,

have you?



   

                   

Uh, well, uh...



   

                   

No, no way!



   

                   

But if it was an inside job



   

                   

I'd put my money on Waxford.



   

                   

Waxford?



   

                   

Yeah, the one at station six.



   

                   

You know,

he's got them shifty eyes.



   

                   

Hey, Waxford!



   

                   

Sulley!



   

                   

Michael Wazowski!



   

                   

Last night was one

of the worst nights



   

                   

of my entire life, bar none!



   

                   

I thought

you cared about me.



   

                   

Honey, please.



   

                   

Schmoopsie, I thought

you liked sushi.



   

                   

Sushi? Sushi?!!



   

                   

You think this is about sushi?!



   

                   

Wazowski!



   

                   

Michael! Mike...



   

                   

Men.



   

                   

Breathe. Keep breathing.



   

                   

Whew.



   

                   

Yikes!



   

                   

Where's the kid?



   

                   

Kid? What kid?



   

                   

It's here in

the factory, isn't it?



   

                   

You're not pinning this on me.



   

                   

It never would have gotten out



   

                   

if you hadn't been

cheating last night!



   

                   

Cheating?



   

                   

Cheating. Right.



   

                   

Okay, I think I know how

to make this all go away.



   

                   

What happens when the whistle

blows in five minutes?



   

                   

Uh... I get a time-out?



   

                   

Everyone goes to lunch!



   

                   

Which means the scare floor

will be...?



   

                   

Painted?



   

                   

Empty! It'll be

empty, you idiot!



   

                   

You see that clock?



   

                   

When the big hand

is pointing up



   

                   

and the little hand

is pointing up



   

                   

the kid's door

will be in my station.



   

                   

But when the big hand

points down



   

                   

the door will be gone.



   

                   

You have until then

to put the kid back.



   

                   

Get the picture?



   

                   

Boo!



   

                   

No.



   

                   

Hey, you! Halt!



   

                   

He's the one.



   

                   

The one from the commercial!



   

                   

Affirmative. That's him.



   

                   

Can we get an autograph?



   

                   

Oh, oh, sure. No problem.



   

                   

You can make that out

to Bethany, my daughter.



   

                   

Yes. Let's see...



   

                   

"From your scary friend



   

                   

best wishes..."



   

                   

So I said,

"If you talk to me



   

                   

like that again,

we're through!"



   

                   

What'd she say?



   

                   

You know my mom.



   

                   

She sent me to my room.



   

                   

See you guys later,

take it easy.



   

                   

Bottoms up!



   

                   

No!



   

                   

Whoa!



   

                   

Hey.



   

                   

Oh, well, hello, there.



   

                   

What's your name?



   

                   

Mike Wazowski!



   

                   

Sulley!



   

                   

Oh, Sulley.



   

                   

Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.



   

                   

Hey, you guys seen

Sulley anywhere?



   

                   

Nope. Sorry.



   

                   

Oh, Sulley!



   

                   

Boy, Wazowski looks

like he's in trouble.



   

                   

    !



   

                   

We have a     !



   

                   

Oh, dear.



   

                   

Get him!



   

                   

Sulley? Sulley!



   

                   

Sulley!



    

                   

Oh, great news, pal.



    

                   

I got us a way out of this mess



    

                   

but we got to hurry.



    

                   

Where is it?



    

                   

Sull, that's a cube of garbage.



    

                   

Uh-oh.



    

                   

L-I can still hear

her little voice.



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

Hey, I can hear her, too.



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

How many kids

you got in there?



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

Boo, oh,

you're all right!



    

                   

I was so worried!



    

                   

Don't you ever run away from me

again, young lady!



    

                   

Oh, but I'm so glad

you're safe.



    

                   

My, what an affectionate father.



    

                   

Actually, she's

my cousin's sister's...



    

                   

Okay, Sulley.



    

                   

That's enough. Let's go.



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

Yeah, yeah.



    

                   

Step aside, kid. We're in a...



    

                   

Will you stop

making Boo laugh?



    

                   

I didn't, so come on!



    

                   

I still don't understand.

You've got Boo's door?



    

                   

I'll explain later.

Run.



    

                   

Okay, let's move,

let's move, let's move.



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

Oh, please be there, please

be there, please be there.



    

                   

There it is!



    

                   

Just like Randall said!



    

                   

Randall? Wait a minute.



    

                   

Oh, hey.



    

                   

One, two, three, four!



    

                   

Get the kid back

through the door!



    

                   

Hey, hey.



    

                   

We're going to get

our lives back.



    

                   

The nightmare is over.



    

                   

Hey, it's okay, Boo.



    

                   

What's the matter?



    

                   

Come on, it's time to move!



    

                   

Mike, what are you thinking?



    

                   

We can't trust Randall.



    

                   

He's after Boo.



    

                   

Who cares? Let's go.



    

                   

This is a limited time offer.



    

                   

No, no.



    

                   

I don't like this.



    

                   

Look, Sulley, you wanted

her door and there it is.



    

                   

Now, let's move.



    

                   

No, Mike.



    

                   

You want me to prove

everything's on the up-and-up?



    

                   

Fine! He wants the door,

I get the door...



    

                   

Mike, wait!



    

                   

He's a paranoid delusional

furball.



    

                   

Mike!



    

                   

Shh, shh, shh.



    

                   

Hey, Sulley,

where you been all day?



    

                   

Sulley? Sulley?



    

                   

Huh?



    

                   

Mike?



    

                   

Mike?



    

                   

Where are you?



    

                   

You in there?



    

                   

Where are you, buddy?



    

                   

Mike?



    

                   

Hey.



    

                   

Boo, way to go.



    

                   

It's okay.



    

                   

Yes! I got the kid!



    

                   

Oh, huzzah!



    

                   

That's great news.



    

                   

Not that I was concerned,

of course.



    

                   

Just get over here and help me!



    

                   

Come on, come on, come on.



    

                   

While we're young here, Fungus!



    

                   

Kid needs to take

off a few pounds.



    

                   

Wazowski?!



    

                   

Where is it,

you little one-eyed cretin?



    

                   

Okay, first of all,

it's cree-tin.



    

                   

If you're going to threaten me,

do it properly.



    

                   

Second of all, you're nuts

if you think kidnapping me



    

                   

is going to help you cheat

your way to the top!



    

                   

You still think this is about

that stupid scare record?



    

                   

Well... I did, right up

until you chuckled like that



    

                   

and now I'm thinking

I should just get out of here.



    

                   

I am about to revolutionize

the scaring industry



    

                   

and when I do, even

the great James P. Sullivan



    

                   

is going to be working for me.



    

                   

Well



    

                   

somebody's certainly

been a busy bee.



    

                   

First, I need to know

where the kid is



    

                   

and you're going to tell me.



    

                   

Yeah, I don't know anything.



    

                   

Uh-huh, sure.



    

                   

I don't.



    

                   

I mean, I don't.



    

                   

Oh-oh.



    

                   

What's that?



    

                   

Come on. Wait, wait, wait.



    

                   

Oh-oh. Oh-oh. Oh, come on.



    

                   

No, no, no, no, no.



    

                   

Come on, hey, hey, hey.



    

                   

This thing is moving.



    

                   

I don't like big...



    

                   

moving things that are

moving towards me.



    

                   

No! Come on!



    

                   

Hey, Randall!



    

                   

Say hello

to the scream extractor.



    

                   

Hello.



    

                   

Come on, where you going?



    

                   

We'll talk.



    

                   

Come on, we'll have a latte!



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

We can talk about this.



    

                   

What's that thing?

What is that thing?



    

                   

Wait, wait, wait!



    

                   

Stop, stop!



    

                   

No, no!



    

                   

Come on, hey!



    

                   

Help! Help! Help!



    

                   

Help!



    

                   

Oh, for...



    

                   

What did you

do wrong this time?



    

                   

I don't know.



    

                   

I calibrated the drive...



    

                   

Go check the machine!



    

                   

There must be something wrong

with the scream intake valve.



    

                   

That's the problem

with these      units...



    

                   

Huh?



    

                   

Hmm.



    

                   

Psst!



    

                   

Fungus. Fungus.



    

                   

You like cars, huh?



    

                   

'Cause I got a really nice car.



    

                   

If you let me go,

I'll give you...



    

                   

a ride in the car.



    

                   

Please, Fungus?



    

                   

I'm sorry, Wazowski,

but Randall said



    

                   

I'm not allowed to fraternize

with victims of his evil plot.



    

                   

Hmm...



    

                   

What happened?



    

                   

Where's Wazowski?



    

                   

Where is he?!



    

                   

Come on!



    

                   

This is crazy.

He's going to kill us!



    

                   

Careful. That could be

contaminated.



    

                   

We got to get out of here now!



    

                   

We can start a whole new life

somewhere far away.



    

                   

Good-bye, Monsters, Inc.!



    

                   

Good-bye, Mr. Waternoose!



    

                   

No, Mike, wait!



    

                   

Hey, what are you doing?



    

                   

Follow me. I have an idea.



    

                   

No! No, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no...



    

                   

Simulation terminated.



    

                   

No, no, no, no, no.



    

                   

What was that?



    

                   

You're trying to scare the kid,

not lull it to sleep.



    

                   

I was going

for a snake/ninja approach



    

                   

with a little hissing.



    

                   

How many times

do I have to tell you?



    

                   

It's all about presence!



    

                   

About how you enter the room!



    

                   

Mr. Waternoose!



    

                   

James! Perfect timing.



    

                   

No, no.

Sir, you don't understand.



    

                   

Ah, now, show these monsters

how it's done.



    

                   

What? No, no, I can't...



    

                   

Sir... sir, you have



    

                   

to listen to me.



    

                   

Pay attention, everyone.



    

                   

You're about to see



    

                   

the best in the business.



    

                   

Reset the simulator.



    

                   

But-but, sir!



    

                   

Good night, sweetheart.



    

                   

Night, Mom.



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

No, Boo, no, no!



    

                   

Now, give us a big, loud roar.



    

                   

Mr. Waternoose,

there's no time for this.



    

                   

Come on. What are you

waiting for? Roar!



    

                   

But-but-but, sir!



    

                   

Roar!



    

                   

Well done.



    

                   

Well done, James.



    

                   

Boo?



    

                   

- All right, gentlemen,

I hope you've learned...

- Right this way, everyone.



    

                   

...a valuable lesson

in scaring today.



    

                   

Boo.



    

                   

Boo?



    

                   

Boo, it's me.



    

                   

The child!



    

                   

Sir, she isn't toxic.



    

                   

I know it sounds

crazy, but trust me.



    

                   

Boo?



    

                   

No, no, no, no.



    

                   

It's okay.



    

                   

I was just...



    

                   

No, no, no, no, no,

don't be scared.



    

                   

That wasn't real.



    

                   

It's just a...



    

                   

I was just...



    

                   

No...



    

                   

Boo.



    

                   

...and he was going

to test it out



    

                   

on that sweet, little girl.



    

                   

- Boo.

- Now that we have her...



    

                   

...he is trying to kill us.



    

                   

This whole thing

is Randall's fault.



    

                   

Randall?



    

                   

Yes. And we can take you to his

secret lab, which is right here



    

                   

in this factory.



    

                   

How could this happen?



    

                   

Oh, how could this happen?



    

                   

Does anyone else

know about this?



    

                   

No, sir.



    

                   

Good.



    

                   

This company can't afford

any more bad publicity.



    

                   

Now, before we do

anything else, let's...



    

                   

take care of the child.



    

                   

Oh, I never thought things

would come to this...



    

                   

not in my factory.



    

                   

I'm sorry you boys

got mixed up in this.



    

                   

Especially you, James.



    

                   

But now we can set



    

                   

everything straight again

for the good of the company.



    

                   

Uh...



    

                   

sir, that's not her door.



    

                   

I know, I know.



    

                   

It's yours.



    

                   

No!



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

No! No!



    

                   

No! No! No! No!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

It's too late!



    

                   

We're banished, genius.



    

                   

We're in the human world!



    

                   

Oh, what a great idea, going

to your old pal Waternoose!



    

                   

Too bad he was in

on the whole thing!



    

                   

All you had to do was listen

to me... just once!



    

                   

But you didn't, did you?



    

                   

You're still not listening!



    

                   

Take that!



    

                   

Welcome to the Himalayas!



    

                   

"Abominable"!



    

                   

Can you believe that?



    

                   

Do I look abominable to you?



    

                   

Why can't they call me

the Adorable Snowman or...



    

                   

or the Agreeable Snowman,

for crying out loud?



    

                   

I'm a nice guy.



    

                   

Snow cone?



    

                   

Yuck.



    

                   

No, no, no.



    

                   

Don't worry... it's lemon.



    

                   

Uh, how about you, big fella?



    

                   

Snow cone?



    

                   

Did you see the way she...

Iooked at me?



    

                   

Ah, poor guy.



    

                   

I understand.



    

                   

It ain't easy being banished.



    

                   

Take my buddy, Bigfoot.



    

                   

When he was banished



    

                   

he fashioned an enormous diaper

out of poison ivy.



    

                   

Wore it on his head

like a tiara.



    

                   

Called himself King ltchy.



    

                   

Ah, it won't be so hard for

you guys, though, you know.



    

                   

I mean, how lucky

can you get?



    

                   

Banished with your

best friend.



    

                   

He is not my friend.



    

                   

Oh. I just assumed you

were buddies, you know



    

                   

when I saw you out

there in the snow



    

                   

hugging and all that.



    

                   

Look at that big jerk.



    

                   

Ruined my life, and for what?



    

                   

A stupid kid!



    

                   

Because of you, I am now stuck



    

                   

in this frozen wasteland!



    

                   

Wasteland?



    

                   

I think you mean wonderland!



    

                   

I mean, how about

all this fabulous snow, huh?



    

                   

Oh, and wait till you see

the local village.



    

                   

Cutest thing in the world.



    

                   

I haven't even mentioned

all the free yak's milk.



    

                   

What... what did you say?



    

                   

Yak's milk.



    

                   

Milking a yak

ain't exactly a picnic.



    

                   

You know, once you pick

the hairs out



    

                   

it's very nutritious.



    

                   

No, no. Something

about a village.



    

                   

Where? Are there kids in it?



    

                   

Kids? Sure.



    

                   

Tough kids, sissy kids,

kids who climb on rocks...



    

                   

Where is it?!



    

                   

It's at the bottom

of the mountain.



    

                   

Around a three-day hike.



    

                   

Oh, three days?!



    

                   

We need to get there now!



    

                   

You want to go to the village?



    

                   

Okay, rule number one

out here.



    

                   

Always...



    

                   

No.



    

                   

Never go out in a blizzard.



    

                   

We need to get to Boo.



    

                   

Boo?!



    

                   

What about us?



    

                   

Ever since that kid came in



    

                   

you've ignored

everything I've said



    

                   

and now look where we are!



    

                   

Oh, we were about

to break the record, Sulley.



    

                   

We would have had it made!



    

                   

None of that matters now.



    

                   

None of it matter...



    

                   

Wa-wait a second.



    

                   

None of it matters?



    

                   

Okay.



    

                   

That's... no. Good. Great.



    

                   

So, now the truth comes out,

doesn't it?



    

                   

Oh, would you look at that?



    

                   

We're out of snow cones, uh...



    

                   

Let me... just go outside



    

                   

and make some more.



    

                   

Sulley, what about everything

we ever worked for?



    

                   

Does that matter? Huh?



    

                   

And what about Celia?



    

                   

I am never... never

going to see her again.



    

                   

Doesn't that matter?



    

                   

What about me?



    

                   

I'm your pal.



    

                   

I'm... I'm your best friend.



    

                   

Don't I matter?



    

                   

I'm sorry, Mike.



    

                   

I'm sorry we're stuck out here.



    

                   

I didn't mean

for this to happen.



    

                   

But Boo's in trouble.



    

                   

I think there might

be a way to save her



    

                   

if we can just

get down to that...



    

                   

"We"?



    

                   

Whoa, whoa, whoa. "We"?



    

                   

No.



    

                   

There's no "we" this time, pal.



    

                   

If-if-if you want

to go out there



    

                   

and freeze to death



    

                   

you be my guest...



    

                   

because you're on your own.



    

                   

Hey, I got more snow cones!



    

                   

Ohh!



    

                   

Ahh!



    

                   

Ahh!



    

                   

Oh, come on, now, George.

I know you can do this.



    

                   

I picked out an easy door

for you... in Nepal.



    

                   

Nice, quiet Nepal.



    

                   

You know, you're right.



    

                   

Here, take this.



    

                   

Go get 'em, Georgie!



    

                   

Gangway! Look out!

Coming through!



    

                   

Sorry, George.



    

                   

Hey, you can't just...



    

                   

  ...



    

                   

Out of the way!



    

                   

- Hey!

- Whoa!



    

                   

Don't!



    

                   

Finally!



    

                   

I never should have

trusted you with this.



    

                   

Because of you, I had

to banish my top scarer!



    

                   

With this machine,

we won't need scarers.



    

                   

Besides, Sullivan got

what he deserved.



    

                   

Sullivan was twice the scarer

you will ever be!



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

Sullivan?



    

                   

Wh-whoa!



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

Sorry, Boo.



    

                   

Stop him!



    

                   

Let's get you home.



    

                   

Ooh!



    

                   

Finish him off!



    

                   

Oh! Ooh! Oh!



    

                   

You don't know how long



    

                   

I've wanted to do

that, Sullivan.



    

                   

Hah!



    

                   

Ooh!



    

                   

Ooh!



    

                   

Mike?!



    

                   

Look, it's not that I

don't care about the kid.



    

                   

Mike, you don't understand.



    

                   

Yes, I do. I was

just mad, that's all.



    

                   

I needed some time to think.



    

                   

But you shouldn't

have left me out there.



    

                   

I'm being attacked!



    

                   

No, I'm not attacking you.



    

                   

I'm trying to be honest.



    

                   

Just hear me out.



    

                   

You and I are a team.



    

                   

Nothing is more important

than our friendship.



    

                   

L-l-I know, kid.



    

                   

He's too sensitive.



    

                   

Come on, pal.



    

                   

If you start crying,

I'm going to cry



    

                   

and I'll never get through this.



    

                   

I'm sorry

I wasn't there for you



    

                   

but I am now.



    

                   

Ow!



    

                   

Sulley, I am baring

my soul here.



    

                   

The least you could do

is pay attention!



    

                   

Hey, look at that...

it's Randall! It's...



    

                   

Oh.



    

                   

Come on!



    

                   

Get up!



    

                   

There can't be any witnesses.



    

                   

There won't be.



    

                   

I'm glad you came back, Mike.



    

                   

Somebody's got to take care

of you, you big hairball.



    

                   

Ow!



    

                   

Schmoopsie-poo,

I really can't talk.



    

                   

Come on!



    

                   

Michael, if you don't tell me



    

                   

what's going on right

now, we are through!



    

                   

You hear me? Through!



    

                   

Here's the truth.



    

                   

You know the kid that they're

looking for... Sulley let her in.



    

                   

We tried to send her back



    

                   

but Waternoose

had this secret plot



    

                   

and now Randall's right behind

us and he's trying to kill us!



    

                   

You expect me to believe that

pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!



    

                   

Move it! Look out, you...



    

                   

Oh!



    

                   

...idiot!



    

                   

Look out. Coming through,

here, coming through!



    

                   

Make way. Move it!



    

                   

Hurry up, hurry up.



    

                   

There they are!



    

                   

Attention, employees:

Randall Boggs



    

                   

has just broken

the all-time scare record.



    

                   

Huh?



    

                   

No, I didn't.



    

                   

Get out of my way!



    

                   

Go get 'em, Googley Bear!



    

                   

There it is!



    

                   

Get off my tail!



    

                   

Let me through!



    

                   

Sulley,

what are you doing?



    

                   

Grab on, Mike!



    

                   

Are you out of your...?



    

                   

Sulley, what are we doing?



    

                   

We have to get Boo's door

and find a station.



    

                   

What a plan...

simple, yet insane!



    

                   

Whoa.



    

                   

Oh, boy.



    

                   

Hold on!



    

                   

Wow!



    

                   

Don't look down!



    

                   

I'm gonna be sick.

I'm gonna be sick!



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

Oh, no!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

Aah...



    

                   

- Boo's door?

- There it is!



    

                   

How are we supposed

to get to it now?



    

                   

Oh, it's a dead end, Sulley!



    

                   

There he is.



    

                   

Make her laugh.



    

                   

What, Sulley?!



    

                   

Just do it!



    

                   

Oh... ow!



    

                   

Get it open.



    

                   

Here he comes.



    

                   

Give me that kid!



    

                   

Why couldn't we

get banished here?



    

                   

Come on. We got to

find another door.



    

                   

Look, Boo's door!



    

                   

There he is!



    

                   

Hurry up, hurry up!



    

                   

Give me your hand.



    

                   

Come on, it slides,

it slides!



    

                   

Ooh, right, right, right.



    

                   

Jump! I'm behind you!



    

                   

Come on!



    

                   

Hurry up! Keep moving!



    

                   

Get inside!



    

                   

Ooh! That was weird.



    

                   

Mike?



    

                   

Oh, sorry, buddy.



    

                   

Oh!



    

                   

I hope that hurt, lizard boy!



    

                   

Great job, buddy. We lost him.



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

Ha, ha!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

Nice working with you!



    

                   

Get it open!



    

                   

- I'm trying!

- Open the door!



    

                   

Come on, get in here!



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

There they are!



    

                   

Sulley, what are you doing?



    

                   

Sulley!



    

                   

Looks like we caught

the express, pal.



    

                   

Do you see them?



    

                   

Straight ahead!



    

                   

No...



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

Look at everybody's

favorite scarer now!



    

                   

You stupid, pathetic waste!



    

                   

You've been number one

for too long, Sullivan.



    

                   

Now your time is up!



    

                   

And don't worry.



    

                   

I'll take good care of the kid.



    

                   

No!



    

                   

She's not scared

of you anymore.



    

                   

Looks like you're out of a job.



    

                   

All right, come on,

over the plate.



    

                   

Let's see

the ol' stuff here, pal.



    

                   

Come on, now, chuck him,

chuck him, baby. Hum, baby.



    

                   

Hum, baby, here's the pitch.



    

                   

Wait, please, don't,

don't, don't!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

And he is... out of here!



    

                   

Mama, another gator

got in the house.



    

                   

Another gator?!



    

                   

Give me that shovel! Come here!



    

                   

Get him, Mama! Get that gator!



    

                   

Care to do the honors, Mikey?



    

                   

With pleasure.



    

                   

That's right, Boo.



    

                   

You did it.



    

                   

You beat him.



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

Okay, Boo, it's time to go home.



    

                   

Take care of yourself,

and be a good girl, okay?



    

                   

Oh, no!



    

                   

The power's out!



    

                   

Make her laugh again.



    

                   

All right, I got a move here.



    

                   

It'll bring down the house.



    

                   

Up...



    

                   

Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.



    

                   

What?! What'd you do,

forget to check



    

                   

if her stupid hood was up



    

                   

ya big dope?!



    

                   

Uncle Mike, try not to yell

in front of her.



    

                   

You know we still need her

to laugh.



    

                   

Right.



    

                   

Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!



    

                   

Funny, right? Huh?

See what the...



    

                   

These are the jokes, kid.



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

What's happening?



    

                   

Hold on!



    

                   

When the door lands

in this station, cut the power.



    

                   

You'll have the child

and the criminals responsible



    

                   

for this whole mess.



    

                   

Great.

A welcoming committee!



    

                   

What are we going to do?!



    

                   

This is the CDA.



    

                   

Come out slowly



    

                   

with the child in plain sight.



    

                   

Okay, okay.



    

                   

You got us.



    

                   

Here we are.



    

                   

Here's the kid.



    

                   

I'm cooperating.



    

                   

But before you take us away,

I have one thing to say:



    

                   

Catch!



    

                   

    !



    

                   

We have a toxic projectile!



    

                   

Halt! After the suspect!



    

                   

Cover the area!

Bring in reinforcements!



    

                   

Stop him!



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

Don't let them get away.



    

                   

What...?!



    

                   

No, wait, wait!



    

                   

Come back! He has the child!



    

                   

Sullivan? Sullivan!



    

                   

Give me the child!



    

                   

Me not go!



    

                   

Give her to me!



    

                   

Open this door!

Open this door!



    

                   

Hey!



    

                   

Sullivan!



    

                   

Don't do it.



    

                   

Come on.



    

                   

Don't go in that room!



    

                   

I think we stopped him, Boo.



    

                   

You're safe now.



    

                   

You be a good girl, okay?



    

                   

This has gone far enough, James.



    

                   

She's home now!

Just leave her alone!



    

                   

I can't do that!



    

                   

She's seen too much.



    

                   

You both have.



    

                   

It doesn't have to be this way.



    

                   

I have no choice!



    

                   

Times have changed.



    

                   

Scaring isn't enough anymore.



    

                   

But kidnapping children?!



    

                   

I'll kidnap

a thousand children



    

                   

before I let this company die



    

                   

and I'll silence anyone



    

                   

who gets in my way!



    

                   

No!



    

                   

Good night, Mom.



    

                   

Good night, sweetheart.



    

                   

Good night, Mom.



    

                   

What, wh-what is this?!

What? Who? Huh?



    

                   

Simulation terminated.

Simulation terminated.



    

                   

Well, I don't know

about the rest of you guys



    

                   

but I spotted

several big mistakes.



    

                   

But-but-but how-how did...?

How did...?



    

                   

You know what?



    

                   

Let's watch my favorite part

again... shall we?



    

                   

I'll kidnap a thousand children

before I let this company die.



    

                   

What...? Wha...?



    

                   

I'll kidnap

a thousand children before...



    

                   

Shh, shh, shh, shh!



    

                   

Shh!



    

                   

I'll get him.



    

                   

All right, come with us, sir.



    

                   

Wh-what are you doing?



    

                   

Take your hands off me!



    

                   

You can't arrest me!



    

                   

I hope you're happy, Sullivan!



    

                   

You've destroyed this company.

Monsters, Incorporated is dead!



    

                   

Where will everyone

get their scream now?!



    

                   

The energy crisis

will only get worse



    

                   

because of you!



    

                   

Stay where you are.



    

                   

Huh?



    

                   

Number One

wants to talk to you.



    

                   

Attention!



    

                   

Hello, boys.



    

                   

Roz?!



    

                   

Two and a half years

of undercover work



    

                   

were almost wasted



    

                   

when you intercepted

that child, Mr. Sullivan.



    

                   

Of course, without your help,

I never would have known



    

                   

that this went all the way up

to Waternoose.



    

                   

Now...



    

                   

about the girl...



    

                   

I just want to send her home.



    

                   

Very good.



    

                   

Bring me a door shredder.



    

                   

What, you mean... you mean,

I can't see her again?



    

                   

That's the way it has to be.



    

                   

I'll give you five minutes.



    

                   

Well, so long, kid.



    

                   

Mike Wazowski!



    

                   

Yeah.



    

                   

Ah, Boo, it's been fun.



    

                   

Go ahead.



    

                   

Go grow up.



    

                   

Uh-uh, B-Boo...?



    

                   

Um... Boo?



    

                   

Oh, look at that.



    

                   

Yeah, you know...



    

                   

Oh, that's cute, yeah.



    

                   

Uh, Boo, um...



    

                   

Well, that's very nice.



    

                   

Come here, you!



    

                   

Oh, he's a happy bear...



    

                   

Nothing's coming

out of your closet



    

                   

to scare you anymore, right?



    

                   

Mm...



    

                   

Yeah.



    

                   

Good-bye, Boo.



    

                   

Kitty.



    

                   

Kitty has to go.



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

Kitty?



    

                   

None of this



    

                   

ever happened, gentlemen.



    

                   

And I don't want to see

any paperwork on this.



    

                   

Take him away.



    

                   

I bet we get

the rest of the day off.



    

                   

You idiot!



    

                   

They're going to shut down

the factory!



    

                   

I'm telling you, pal,

when that wall went up



    

                   

you should have seen the look

on Waternoose's face.



    

                   

Whoo-hoo! I hope we get

a copy of that tape.



    

                   

Hey, you all right?



    

                   

Come on, pal,

cheer up, we did it!



    

                   

We got Boo home.



    

                   

Ah, sure, we put the factory

in the toilet, and...



    

                   

gee, hundreds of people

will be out of work now.



    

                   

Not to mention the angry mob

that'll come after us



    

                   

when there's no more power,

but, hey...



    

                   

at least we had

some laughs, right?



    

                   

Laughs...



    

                   

Hey, is this thing on? Hello?



    

                   

Hello? Testing, testing.



    

                   

Hey, good evening. How are you?



    

                   

How are you? Nice to see you.



    

                   

I tell you, it's good

to be here in... your room.



    

                   

Where you from?



    

                   

Never mind.



    

                   

You're in kindergarten, right?



    

                   

Oh, I love kindergarten.



    

                   

Best three years of my life.



    

                   

Of my life.



    

                   

But I love sports.



    

                   

Dodgeball was the best.



    

                   

Oh, yeah.



    

                   

I was the fastest one out there.



    

                   

Course I was the ball.



    

                   

But I...



    

                   

was the ball, see?



    

                   

All right.



    

                   

Ah...



    

                   

Ah?



    

                   

Hey, thanks a lot.



    

                   

I'll be here all week.



    

                   

Remember to tip your waitresses.



    

                   

Great job, Mikey.



    

                   

You filled your quota on

the first kid of the day.



    

                   

Not bad, huh?



    

                   

You know, only somebody

with perfect comedic timing



    

                   

could produce this much energy

in one shot.



    

                   

Uh-huh, and the fact

that laughter is



    

                   

ten times more

powerful than scream



    

                   

had nothing to do with it.



    

                   

Oh, Googley Bear.



    

                   

Come here, you.



    

                   

Schmoopsie-poo!



    

                   

Googley.



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

Girls!

Girls, put...



    

                   

Stop, stop, stop!



    

                   

Michael, you're such a charmer.



    

                   

Hey, did you bring the magazine?



    

                   

They just delivered a whole box.



    

                   

Let me see it!



    

                   

Sulley and I

made the cover, right?



    

                   

I don't believe it.



    

                   

Googley Bear...



    

                   

I'm on the cover of a magazine!



    

                   

Ow!



    

                   

Oh, this is great!



    

                   

Oh.



    

                   

Hey, Sulley!



    

                   

Hey, uh, Mike.

I was, uh, just...



    

                   

Well, listen,

if you got a minute



    

                   

there's something

I want to show you.



    

                   

But-but-but...



    

                   

Okay, close your eyes.



    

                   

Follow me. Come on.



    

                   

I-I-I...



    

                   

No peeking.



    

                   

Keep coming, keep coming,

keep coming.



    

                   

Come on, keep coming.



    

                   

Keep coming, keep coming.



    

                   

Mike...



    

                   

Follow the sultry

sound of my voice.



    

                   

Okay, stop.

Open them.



    

                   

Ta-da!



    

                   

Mike...



    

                   

Is that...?



    

                   

Sorry it took



    

                   

so long, pal.



    

                   

It was a lot of wood

to go through.



    

                   

You know, it only works



    

                   

if you have every piece.



    

                   

Boo?



    

                   

Kitty!



    

                   

- Speed.

- Marker.



    

                   

And... action.



    

                   

With a million or two



    

                   

I'd live in a penthouse



    

                   

In a room with a view



    

                   

And if I were handsome



    

                   

No way.



    

                   

It could happen.



    

                   

Those dreams do come true



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have you



    

                   

Wouldn't have nothing if I

didn't have



    

                   

Wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have



    

                   

Wouldn't have nothing...



    

                   

Okay, cut.



    

                   

Okay, you finished now, right?



    

                   

Hello?



    

                   

Hello.



    

                   

Come on, get lost, you two.



    

                   

You're making him lose

his focus.



    

                   

Oh, sorry.



    

                   

See you later, fellas.



    

                   

Go get 'em, Mr. Solomon.



    

                   

You idiot!



    

                   

It's Sullivan, not Solomon!



    

                   

What?



    

                   

You're messing up the scene!



    

                   

Sorry.



    

                   

We're never going to work

in Hollywood again!



    

                   

Let me do it over.



    

                   

Shut up!



    

                   

Keep rolling!



    

                   

You're making it worse!



    

                   

Duck and cover, people!



    

                   

Hey, thanks, guys.



    

                   

That was a close one.



    

                   

Ta-da!



    

                   

Oh, Boo, it's been fun.



    

                   

Go ahead.



    

                   

Go throw up.



    

                   

What? What did I say?



    

                   

What? What?



    

                   

Cut.



    

                   

Hey, Ted!



    

                   

Good morning!



    

                   

Cut.



    

                   

Hey, how was that? Was I scary?



    

                   

Do I get the part?



    

                   

Thank you.



    

                   

Can I do it again?



    

                   

I can be taller!



    

                   

Next!



    

                   

And action!



    

                   

Okay, let's move.

Let's move, let's move!



    

                   

Ow!



    

                   

Can we get a little more wax

on the floor, please?



    

                   

Wait a minute. Randall?



    

                   

That cheater!



    

                   

He's trying

to boost his numbers!



    

                   

There's something else.



    

                   

What?!



    

                   

Look-lay in the bag-bay.



    

                   

I think you mean

"Ook-lay in the ag-bay."



    

                   

What? Didn't I...?



    

                   

Well, you know, maybe

you should just take a minute



    

                   

and ead-ray your ipt-scray.



    

                   

You think he's going

to come through the closet



    

                   

and scare you.



    

                   

Oh, boy, how do I explain this?



    

                   

Uh, it's empty.



    

                   

See?



    

                   

Guess who.



    

                   

Hey, what's the...



    

                   

Okay, very funny.



    

                   

Hey, I look good in a suit.



    

                   

Marker.



    

                   

Let her rip.



    

                   

Go.



    

                   

Whoa!



    

                   

Shut it off! Shut it off!



    

                   

Pull the lever!



    

                   

You're making it worse!



    

                   

But I must admit it



    

                   

Big guy,

you always come through



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have you



    

                   

You and me together



    

                   

That's how it

always should be



    

                   

One without the other

don't mean nothing to me



    

                   

Nothing to me...



    

                   

Oh, hey!

It's a work in progress.

Your seat is right

over there, sir.



    

                   

Boo!



    

                   

There's a child,

there's a child



    

                   

There's a human child



    

                   

Oh, no!



    

                   

Running 'round

the restaurant



    

                   

This is really wild



    

                   

What in heaven's name

will become of us



    

                   

We who are living

in Monstropolis?



    

                   

All right, Wazowski.



    

                   

Tell us where the kid is.



    

                   

I will never talk!



    

                   

Never!



    

                   

She's out of our hair



    

                   

And just when I dare...

to care



    

                   

She says, "au contraire"



    

                   

You're my pair... of friends



    

                   

I love you.



    

                   

Keep it together, man!



    

                   

And so we put that kid

back where she came from



    

                   

And she helped us to find



    

                   

A better tomorrow today!



    

                   

Thank you!



    

                   

What a night for my mother

to be in the audience!



    

                   

Ladies and gentlemen



    

                   

my mom!



    

                   

Thank you, Monstropolis!



    

                   

I don't have to say it



    

                   

Ah, say it anyway.



    

                   

'Cause we...



    

                   

Both know it's true



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing if I

didn't have



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have you



    

                   

Wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have you.



    

                   

One more time.



    

                   

It worked!



    

                   

I don't have to say it



    

                   

I'm gonna anyway!



    

                   

'Cause we both know

it's true



    

                   

Let's take it home, big guy.



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing if I

didn't have



    

                   

I wouldn't have nothing

if I didn't have you



    

                   

You, you



    

                   

A, E, I, O...



    

                   

That means you, yeah.

<p><center>Shrek Script
<p><center>{Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only 

be broken by love's first kiss.

She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing 

dragon.

Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, 

but non prevailed.

She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest 

tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.

{Laughing} 

Like that's ever gonna happen.

{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}

What a load of - 



SOMEBODY once told me the world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'

Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'

Didn't make sense not to live for fun

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see

So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets

You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now You're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

You're bundled up now but wait till you get older

But the meteor men beg to differ

Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin

The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

My world's on fire

How 'bout yours

That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all-star

{Shouting}

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

{Belches}

Go!

Go!

{Record Scratching}

Go. Go.Go.

Hey, now, you're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold



-Think it's in there?

-All right. Let's get it!

-Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

-Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.

{Laughs}

-Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint.

Now, ogres - - They're much worse.

They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.

-No!

-They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!

Actually, it's quite good on toast.

-Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

{Gasping}

-Right.

{Roaring}

{Shouting}

{Roaring}

{Whispers} This is the part where you run away.

{Gasping}

{Laughs}

{Laughing} And stay out!

"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."

{Sighs}

{Man's voice} All right. This one's full.

-Take it away!

{Gasps}

-Move it along. Come on! Get up!

-Next!

-Give me that! Your fiying days are over.

That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

-Get up! Come on!

-Twenty pieces.

{Thudding}

-Sit down there!

-Keep quiet!

{Crying}

-This cage is too small.

-Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again.

I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

-Oh, shut up.

-Oh!

-Next!

-What have you got?

-This little wooden puppet.

-I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

-Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

-Father, please! Don't let them do this!

-Help me!

-Next! What have you got?

-Well, I've got a talking donkey.

{Grunts}

-Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.

-Oh, go ahead, little fella.

-Well?

-Oh, oh, he's just - - He's just a little nervous.

He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt - -

-That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

-No, no, he talks! He does. I can talk. I love to talk.

I'm the talkingest darn thing you ever saw.

-Get her out of my sight.

-No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

{Gasps}

-Hey! I can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can talk!

-Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly

but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha!

Oh-oh.

{Grunts}

-Seize him!

-After him! He's getting away!

{Grunts, Gasps}

{Man}

-Get him! This way! Turn!

-You there. Orge!

-Aye?

-By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under 

arrest

and transport you to a designated..... resettlement facility.

-Oh, really? You and what army?

{Gasps, Whimpering}

{Chuckles}

-Can I say something to you?

-Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. 

Incredible!

Are you talkin' to - - me? Whoa!

-Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great 

back here? Those guards!

They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They 

was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made 

me feel good to see that.

-Oh, that's great. Really.

-Man, it's good to be free.

-Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? 

Hmm?

-But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by 

myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. 

You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit 

out of anybody that crosses us.

{Roaring}

-Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that 

don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you 

definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks!

You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - 

{Mumbling}

Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my 

butt that day.

-Why are you following me?

-I'll tell you why. 



'Cause I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

My promlems have all gone

There's no one to deride me

But you gotta heve friends - - 



-Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.

-Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.

-Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

-Uh - - Really tall?

-No! I'm an orge! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't 

that bother you?

-Nope.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Oh.

-Man, I like you. What's you name?

-Uh, Shrek.

-Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?

You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.

I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. 

Who'd want to live in place like that?

-That would be my home.

-Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a 

decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I 

like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

-I guess you don't entertain much, do you?

-I like my privacy.

-You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I 

hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them 

a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.

-Can I stay with you?

-Uh, what?

-Can I stay with you, please?

-Of course!

-Really?

-No.

-Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to 

be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta 

stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

-Okay! Okay! But one night only.

-Ah! Thank you!

-What are you - - No! No!

-This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, 

and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

-Oh!

-Where do, uh, I sleep?

-OUTSIDE!

-Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you 

don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know.

{Sniffles}

-Here I go.

-Good night.

{Sighs}

-I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. 

I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, 

outside.



I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

{Bubbling}

{Sighs}

{Creaking}

{Sighs}

-I thought I told you to stay outside.

-I'm outside.

{Clattering}

-Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we 

have? 

-It's not home, but it'll do just fune.

-What a lovely bed.

-Got ya.

{Sniffs} I found some cheese.

-Ow! {Grunts}

-Blah! Awful stuff.

-Is that you, Gorder?

-How did you know?

-Enough! What are you doing in my house?

{Grunts}

-Hey!

{Snickers}

-Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.

-Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.

-Huh?

{Gusps}

{Male voice} What?

-I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying orge! What do I 

have to do get a little privacy?

-Aah!

-Oh, no. No! No!

{Cackling}

-What?

-Quit it.

-Don't push.

{Squeaking}

{Lows}

- WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY SWAMP?

{Echoing}

Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

{Gasping}

-Oh, dear!

-Whoa!

-All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! 

Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!

-Quickly. Come on!

-No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there.

-Oh!

{Sighs}

-Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

-Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

-What?

-We were forced to come here.

-By who?

-Lord Farquaad.

-He huffed und he puffed und he...... signed an eviction notice.

{Sighs}

-All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

{Murmuring}

-Oh, I do. I know where he is.

-Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?

-Me! Me!

-Anyone?

-Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

{Sighs}

-Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. 

Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy 

Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came 

from!

{Cheering}

{Twittering}

-Oh! You! You're comin' with me.

- All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two 

stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!

-On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek.

-Hey. Oh, oh!

-I can't wait to get on the road again.

-What did I say about singing?

-Can I whistle?

-No.

-Can I hum it?

-All right, hum it.

{Humming}



{Grunts}

{Whimpering}

-That's enough. He's ready to talk.

{Coughing}

{Laughing}

{Clears throat}

-Run, run, run, as fust as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the 

gingerbread man!

-You are a monster.

-I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy 

tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the 

others?

-Eat me!{Grunts}

-I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached 

its end! Tell me or I'll - -

-No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons.

-All right then. Who's hiding them?

-Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man.

-Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

-Well, she's married to the muffin man.

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man!

-She's married to the muffin man.

{Door opens}

-My lord! We found it.

-Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in.

{Man grunting}

{Gasping}

-Oh!

-Magic mirror - - 

-Don't tell him anything!

-No!

{Ginerbread man whispers}

-Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect 

kingdom of them all?

-Well, technically you're not a king.

-Uh, Thelonius.

-You were saying?

-What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one.  All 

you have to do is marry a princess.

-Go on.

{Chuckles}

-So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to 

meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette 

number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. 

She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking 

and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.

-Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of 

fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just 

kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come 

on. Give it up for Snow White!

-And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a 

fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling 

lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes 

pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, 

Princess Fiona!

-So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or 

bachelorette number three?

-Two! Two!

-Three! Three!

-Two! Two!

-Three! 

-Three? One?

{Shudders} Three?

--Three! Pick number three, my lord!

-Okay, okay, uh, number three!

-Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.



If you like pina coladas

And getting caught in the rain



-Princess Fiona.



If you're not into yoga



-She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go - - 

-But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.

-I'll do it.

-Yes, but after sunset - -

-Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will 

finally have the perfect king!

Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament.



-But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd 

find it.

-So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

-Uh-huh. That's the place.

-Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?

{Laughs}

{Groans}

-Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

-Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.

-Hey, you!

{Screams}

-Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - -

{Whimpering}

{Sighs}

{Whimpering, Groans}

{Turnstile clatters}

{Chuckles}

{Sighs}

-It's quiet. Too quiet.

{Creaking}

-Where is everybody?

-Hey, look at this!

{Clattering, whirring, clicking}

Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town

Here we have some rules

Let us lay them down

Don't make waves, stay in line

And we'll get along fine

DuLoc is perfect place

Please keep off of the grass

Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

DuLoc is, DuLoc is

DuLoc is perfect ...... place

{Camera shutter clicks

{Whirring}

-Wow! Let's do that again!

-No. No. No, no, no! No.

{Trumpet fanfare}

{Crowd cheering}

-Brave knights.

-You are the best and brightest in all the land.

-Today one of you shall prove himself - -

-All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.

-Sorry about that.

{Cheering}

-That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go 

forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the 

dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first 

runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you mae 

die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

{Cheering}

-Let the tournament begin!

{Gasps}

-Oh!

-What is that?

{Gasping}

-It's hideous!

-Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey.

-Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the orge will be named 

champion! Have it him!

-Get him!

-Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

-Go ahead! Get him!

-Can't we just settle this over a pint?

-Kill the beast!

-No? All right then. Come on!



I don't give a damn about my reputation

You're living in the past 

It's a new generation



-Damn!

{Whinnying}



A girl can do what she wants to do

And that's what I'm gonna do

And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me



-Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Never said I wanted to improve my station



-Ah!

{Laughs}



And I'm always feelin' good when I'm having fun



-Yeah!



And I don't have to please no one



-The chair! Give him the chair!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me, not me

{Bell dings}

{Cheering}

{Laughs}

-Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till 

Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha!

{Shrek laughs}

{Crowd gasping, murmuring}

-Shall I give the order, sir?

-No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!

-What?

-Congratulations, orge. You're won the honor of embarking on a great 

and noble quest.

-Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.

-Your swamp?

-Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures!

{Crowd murmuring}

-Indeed. All right, orge. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for 

me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

-Exactly the way it was?

-Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

-And the squatters?

-As good as gone.

-What kind of quest?

-Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a 

princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only 

don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

-Is that about right?

-Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

-I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on 

him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make 

your bread, the whole orge trip.

-Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and 

put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and 

drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?

-Uh, no, not really, no.

-For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think.

-Example?

-Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions.

-{Sniffs} They stink?

-Yes - - No!

-They make you cry?

-No!

-You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little 

white hairs.

-No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have 

layers. You get it? We both have layers. 

{Sighs}

-Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes 

onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

-I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes.

-You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a 

person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "No, I don't like 

no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.

-No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like 

onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.

-Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

-You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or 

something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start 

slobbering.



I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

And everything that you receive up yonder

Is what you give to me the day I wander

I'm on my way 

I'm on my way 

I'm on my way 



-Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?

-You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was 

open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. {Sniffs} It's 

brimstone We must be getting close.

-Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I 

know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone 

neither.

{Rumbling}

-Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.

{Laughing}

-Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers?

-Oh, aye.

-Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have 

layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

-Wait a second.  Donkeys don't have sleeves.

-You know what I mean.

-You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

-I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over 

a boiling like of lava!

-Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional 

support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step 

at a time.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

-Just keep moving. And don't look  down.

-Okay, don't look  down. Don't look  down. Don't look  down. Keep on 

moving. Don't look  down.

{Gasps}

-Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, 

please! 

-But you're already halfway.

-But I know that half is safe!

-Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

-Shrek, no! Wait!

-Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?

-Don't do that!

-Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

-Oh, this?

-Yes, that!

-Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

{Screams}

-No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

-You said do it! I'm doin' it.

-I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!

-That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

-Cool.

-So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

-Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

{Chuckles}

-I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

{Water dripping, wind howling}

-You afraid?

-No.

-But - -

- Shh.

-Oh, good. Me neither.

{Gasps}

-'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 

response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I 

might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and 

breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little 

scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.

{Gasps}

-Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if 

you can find any stairs.

-Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.

-The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest 

tower.

-What makes you think she'll be there?

-I read it in a book once.

-Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those 

stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way 

they're goin'.

{Creacing}

-I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with 

me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a 

step right here. I'd step all over it.

-Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - 

-Dragon!

{Screams}

{Gasps}

{Roars}

-Donkey, look out!

{Screams}

{Whimpering}

-Got ya!

{Roars}

{Gasps}

{Shouts}

-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

{Screaming}

{Gasps}

-Oh! Aah! Aah!

{Gasping}

{Crowls}

-No. Oh, no, No!

{Screams}

-Oh, what large teeth you have.

{Crowls}

-I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time 

from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile 

you got  there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know 

what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of 

course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 

What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. 

Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh - - 

(Coughs)

-I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna 

blow smoke rings. Shrek!

{Gasps}

{Whimpering}

-No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

{Groans, Sighs}

{Vocalizing}

-Oh! Oh!

-Wake up!

-What?

-Are you Princess Fiona?

-I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

-Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

-But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be 

a wonderful, romantic moment?

-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out 

yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

-You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

-Mm-hmm.

{Screams, grunts}

-But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for 

me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!

-I don't think so.

-Can I at least know the name of my champion?

-Um, Shrek.

-Sir Shrek.

{Cleans throat}

-I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.

-Thanks!

{Roaring}

-You didn't slay the dragon?

-It's on my to-do list. Now come on!

{Screams}

-But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, 

banner flying. That's what all the other knights did.

-Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

-That's not the point. Oh!

-Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there.

-Well, I have to save my ass.

-What kind of knight are you?

-One of a kind.

-Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to 

know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned. 

{Laughs}

-I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not 

emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - -  Magnitude really 

is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted 

physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back 

up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to 

know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, 

but I just love receiving cards - -  I'd really love to stay, but - - 

Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna 

tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with 

that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!

{Growls}

{Roaring}

{Gasps}

-Hi, Princess!

-It talks!

-Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

{Screams}

{Screaming}

-Oh!

{Thuds}

{Groans}

{Roars}

{Roaring}

-Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon.

{Fchoing}

-Run!

{Gasping}

{Screaming}

{Roaring}

{Screams}

{Roars}

{Panting, sighs}

{Whimpers}

{Roars}

-You did it!

-You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. 

You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and 

thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. 

{Clears throat}

-And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

-I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a 

steed.

-The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

-Uh, no.

-Why not?

-I have helmet hair.

-Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

-No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

-But how will you kiss me?

-What? That wasn't in the job description.

-Maybe it's a perk.

-No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in 

a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then 

they share true love's first kiss.

-Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you 

true love?

-Well, yes.

{Laughing}

-You think Shrek is your true love!

-What is so funny?

-Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay?

-Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your 

helmet.

-Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

-Just take off the helmet.

-I'm not going to.

-Take ot off.

-No!

-Now!

-Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.

-You- - You're a- - an orge.

-Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

-Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed 

to be an orge.

{Sighs}

-Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the 

one who wants to marry you.

-Then why didn't he come rescue me?

-Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

-But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- - 

his pet.

-So much for noble steed.

-You're not making my job any easier.

-I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad 

that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right 

here.

-Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.

-You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

-Ya comin', Donkey?

-I'm right behind ya.

-Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not 

dignified! Put me down!

-Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, 

right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down 

real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a 

crisp and eaten?

-You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what 

happens when you find your - -  Hey!

{Sighs}

-The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.

-You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

-And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

-Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in 

short supply.

{Laughs}

-I don't know. There are those who think little of him.

-Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never 

measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

-Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the 

"measuring" when you see him tomorrow.

-Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?

-No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.

-But there's robbers in the woods.

-Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good.

-Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this 

forest.

-I need to find somewhere to camp now!

{Birds wings fluttering}

{Grunting}

-Hey! Over here.

-Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a 

princess.

-No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

-Homey touches? Like what?

{Crashing}

-A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

-You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.

-I said good night!

-Shrek, What are you doing?

{Laughs}

-I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.

{Fire cracking}

-And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over 

three wheat fields. Right. Yeah.

-Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

-The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, 

there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.

-I know you're making this up.

-No, look. There he is,  and there's the group of hunters running away 

from his stench.

-That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

-You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? 

Forget it.

{Sighs}

-Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

-Our swamp?

-You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

-We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my 

swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my 

land.

-You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what 

I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody 

out.

-No, do ya think?

-Are you hidin' something?

-Never mind, Donkey.

-Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

-No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things.

-Why don't you want to talk about it?

-Why do you want to talk about it?

-Why are you blocking?

-I'm not blocking.

-Oh, yes, you are.

-Donkey, I'm warning you.

-Who you trying to keep out?

-Everyone! Okay?

-Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.

-Oh! For the love of Pete!

-What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?

-Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that 

seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. 

"Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!" They judge me before they 

even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.

-You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, 

stupid, ugly orge.

-Yeah, I know.

-So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

-Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.

-Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one 

there?

-That's the moon.

-Oh, okay.



{Orchestra}

{Dulcimer}

-Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the 

princess.

-Hmph.

-Ah. Perfect.

{Inhales}



{Snoring}

{Vocalizing}

{Whistling}

{Sizzling}

{Sniffs, yawns}

-Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.

--Come on, baby. I said I like it.

-Donkey, wake up.

-Huh? What?

-Wake up.

-What?

-Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?

-Good morning, Princess!

-What's all this about?

-You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to 

make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

-Uh, thanks.

{Sniffs}

-Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

{Belches}

-Shrek!

-What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. {Laughs}

-Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.

{Belches}

-Thanks.

-She's as nasty as you are.

-{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

-Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

{Vocalizing}



-La liberte! Hey!

-Princess!

{Laughs}

-What are you doing?

-Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from 

this green - -

{Kissing sounds}

-beast.

-Hey!

-That's my princess! Go find you own!

-Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

-Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!

-Oh! Of couse! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduse myself. Oh, Merry 

Men. 

{Laughs}

-Man, that was annoying!

-Oh, you little- -

{Shouting, groaning}

{Chuckles}

-Uh, shall we?

-Hold the phone.

{Grunts}

Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?

-What?

-That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?

-Well - - {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these 

things in case there's a - - There's an arrow in your butt!

-What? Oh, would you look at that?

-Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

-Why? What's wrong?

-Shrek's hurt.

-Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

-Donkey, I'm okay.

-You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep 

you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the 

Heimlich?

-Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and 

find me a blue flower with red thorns.

-Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. 

Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

-{Both} Donkey!

-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

-What are the flowers for?

-For getting rid of Donkey.

-Ah.

-Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out.

-Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

-No, it's tender.

-Now, hold on.

-What you're doing is the opposite of help.

-Don't move.

-Look, time out.

-Would you - - 

{Grunts}

-Okay. What do you propose we do?

-Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red 

thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue 

flower, red thorns.

-Ow!

-Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!

-Ow! Not good.

-Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head.

{Grunts}

-It's just about - - 

-Ow! Ohh!

-Ahem.

-Nothing happend. We were just, uh - - 

-Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?

-Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was 

just- - Ugh! 

-Ow!

-Hey, what's that?

{Nervous chickle}

-That's- - Is that blood?

{Sighs}

{Bird chirping}

{Grunts}



My beloved monster and me

We go everywhere together

Wearin' a raincoat

that has four sleeves

Gets us through all kinds of weather



-Aah!



She will always be the only thing

That comes between me and the awful sting

That comes from living in a world

that's so damn mean

{Croaks}

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

-Hey!

La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

{Both laughing}

La-la, la-la, la-la



-There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you.

-That's DuLoc?

-Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for 

something,  which I think means he has a really - - Ow!

-Um, I, uh- -  I guess we better move on.

-Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey.

{Blubbering}

-What?

-I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good. 

-What are you talking about? I'm fine.

-That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on 

your back. Dead.

-You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

-Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.

-I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and 

when I turn my head like this, look, 

{Bones crunch}

-Ow! See?

-Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.

-I'll get the firewood.

-Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! I don't have any 

toes! I think I need a hug.



-Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?

-Uh, weedrat. Rotisserie style.

-No kidding. Well, this is delicious.

-Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I 

make a mean weedrat stew.

{Chuckling}

{Sighs}

-I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.

{Gulps}

-Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind 

of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it.

{Chuckles}

-I'd like that.

{Slurps, laughs}



See the pyramids along the Nile



-Um, Princess?



Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle



-Yes, Shrek?

-I, um, I was wondering.



Just remember, darling all the while



-Are you- - 



You belong to me



{Sighs} 

-Are you gonna eat that?

{Chuckles}

-Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.

-Sunset?

-Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.

-What?

-Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, 

aren't you?

-Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.

-Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until 

- - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

{Shrek sighs}

 -Good night.

 -Good night.

{Door creaks}

-Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.

-Oh, what are you talkin' about?

-I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. 

And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

-You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

-Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in 

and tell her how you feel.

-I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, 

well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a 

princess, and I'm - - 

-An orge?

-Yeah. An orge.

-Hey, where you goin'?

-To get... move firewood.

{Sighs} 



-Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you?

{Wings fluttering}

-Princess?

{Creaking}

{Gasps}

-It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

{Screams}

-Aah!

-Oh, no!

-No, help!

-Shh!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-No, it's okay. It's okay.

-What did you do with the princess?

-Donkey, I'm the princess.

-Aah!

-It's me, in this body.

-Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you hear me?

-Donkey!

-Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!

-No!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-Shh.

-Shrek!

-This is me.

{Muffled mumbling}

-Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.

-I'm ugly, okay?

-Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats 

was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - - 

-No.

-I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.

-What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

-It's only happens when sun goes down.

"By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you 

find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."

-Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

-It's a spell.

{Sighs} 

-When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I 

become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to 

await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry 

Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.

{Sobs}

-All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not 

that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look 

like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.

-But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant 

to look.

-Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

-I have to.  Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

-But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you 

got a lot in common.

-Shrek?



-Princess, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for 

me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's 

pretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might 

like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh - 

- 

{Sighs}

-I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

-I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I 

mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? 

"Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here 

with Shrek.

{Gasps}

-My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

{Deep sigh}

-Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only 

way to break the spell.

-You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

-No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

-What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

-Promise you won't tell. Promise!

-All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know 

before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.

-Look at my eye twitchin'.

{Door opens}

{Snoring}

-I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. 

-Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want - - 

{Snoring}

-Shrek. Are you all right?

-Perfect! Never been better.

-I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.

-You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last 

night.

-You heard what I said?

-Every word.

-I thought you'd understand.

-Oh, I undersatnd. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly 

beast?" 

-But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

-Yeah? Well, it does.

{Gasps, sighs}

-Ah, right on time.

{Horse whinnies}

-Princess, I've brought you a little something.

{Fanfare}

{Yawns}

-What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

{Muffled}

-Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

-Princess Fiona.

-As promised. Now hand it over.

-Very well, orge. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

-Take it and go before I change my mind.

-Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I 

have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad.

-Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.

{Snaps fingers}

-Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... farewell.

-Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the 

orge. It's not like it has feelings.

-No, you're right. It doesn't.

-Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawerss Fiona. I ask your hand in 

marriage.

{Gasps}

-Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

-Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - - 

-Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

-No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun 

sets.

-Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's 

so much to do! Threre's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest 

list. Captain, round up some guests!

-Fare-thee-well, orge.

-Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.

-Yeah? So what?

-Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to 

her last night, She's - - 

-I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? 

Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?

-Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

-I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! 

My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, 

pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

-But I thought - - 

-Yeah. You know what? You tought wrong!

-Shrek.



I heard there was a secret chord

That David played and it pleased the Lord

But you don't really care for music, do ya

It goes like this the fourth, the fifth

The minor fall the major lift

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before

I know this room I've walked this floor

I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch

But love is not a victory march

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

And all I ever learned from love

Is how to shoot at someone

Who outdrew you

{Moaning}

And it's not a cry you can hear at night

It's not somebody who's seen the light

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

{Moaning}

Hallelujah,  hallelujah



{Thumping sound}

-Donkey?

{Grunts}

-What are you doing?

-I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see 

one.

-Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not 

through it.

-It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.

-Oh! Your half. Hmm.

-Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I 

get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks 

like your head.

-Back off!

-No, you back off.

-This is my swamp!

-Our swamp.

-Let go, Donkey!

-You let go.

-Stubborn jackass!

-Smelly orge.

-Fine!

-Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.

-Well, I'm through with you.

-Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess 

what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are 

mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! 

You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

-Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

-Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

-Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in 

the back!

-Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your 

own feelings.

-Go away!

-There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she 

ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

-Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of 

you talking. 

-She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody 

else.

-She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?

-Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. 

Right? Right?

-Donkey!

-No!

-Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

{Sighs}

-I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. Can you 

forgive me?

-Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

-Right. Friends?

-Friends.

-So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

-What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

-The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

-Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I 

have a way.

{Whistles}

-Donkey?

-I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

{Laughing}

-Aw, come here, you.

-All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. 

All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install 

the seat belts yet.

-Whoo!

{Bells tolling}

{All gasping}

-People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the union....

-Um-

-of our new king - -

-Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

{Chuckling}

-Go on.

-Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 

that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't 

you?

-What are you talking about?

-There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak 

now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"

-I don't have time for this!

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this 

woman, don't you?

-Yes.

-You wanna hold her?

-Yes.

-Please her?

-Yes!

-Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. The chicks love that 

romantic crap!

-All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

-We gotta check it out.



-And so, by the power vested in me, 

-What do you see?

-The whole town's in there.

-I now pronounce you husband and wife,

-They're at the altar.

-king and queen.

-Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

-Oh, for the love of Pete!

{Grunts}

-I object!

-Shrek?

{Gasps}

-Oh, now what does he want?

-Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first at all. 

Very clean.

-What are you doing here?

-Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but 

showing up uninvited to a wedding - -

-Fiona! I need to talk to you.

-Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll 

excuse me - - 

-But you can't marry him.

-And why not?

-Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.

-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

-He's not your true love.

-And what do you know about true love?

-Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - - 

-Oh, this is precious. The orge has fallen in love with the princess! 

Oh, good Lord.

{Crowd laughting}

-An orge and a princess!

-Shrek, is this true?

-Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away 

from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! Mmmmm!

-"By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before.

{Whimpers}

{Crown gasping}

-Well, uh, that explains a lot.

-Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of 

my sight now! Get them! Get them both!

-No, no!

-Shrek!

-This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that 

makes me king! See? See?

-No, let go of me! Shrek!

-No!

-Don't just stand there, you morons.

-Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! 

-I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and 

quartered!

-You'll beg for death to save you!

-No, Shrek!

-And as for you, my wife,

-Fiona!

-I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!

-I'm king!

{Whistles}

-I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - Aaaah!

-Aah!

-All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to 

use it.

{Roars}

-I'm a donkey on the edge!

{Belches}

-Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

{Cheering}

-Go ahead, Shrek.

-Uh, Fiona?

-Yes, Shrek?

-I - - I love you.

-Really?

-Really, really.

- I love you too.

-Aawww!

-"Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true 

form."

-"Take love's true form. Take love's true form."

-Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?

-Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.

-But you ARE beautiful.

{Chuckles}

-I was hoping this would be a happy ending.



I thought love was only true in fairy tales

Oy!

Meant for someone else but not for me

Love was out to get me

That's the way it seemed

Disappointment haunted all my dreams

And then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer and not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer I couldn't leave her

If I tried



-God bless us, every one.



Come on, y'all!

Then I saw her face

Ha-ha

Now I'm a believer 

Listen!

Not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer 

I couldn't leave her if I tried

-Ooh!

-Uh!

Then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer 

Hey!

Not a trace

Uhh! Yeah.

Of doubt in my mind



-One more time!

I'm in love

I'm a believer 

Come on!

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, 

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, hey

Y'all sing it with me!

I

Believe

I believe

People in the back!

I believe

I'm a believer 

I believe

I believe

I believe

I believe

{Hysterical laughing}

-Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh.

-I can't breathe. I can't breathe. 



I believe in self-assertion

Destiny or a slight diversion

Now it seems I've got my head on straight

I'm a freak an apparition

Seems I've made the right decision

To try to turn back now it might be too late



Now I want to stay home today

Don't wanna go out

If anyone comes to play

Gonna get thrown out

I wanna stay home today

Don't want no company

No way

Yeah, yeah, yeah



I wanna be a millionaire someday

But know what it feels like to give it away

Watch me march to the beat of my own drum

And it's off to the moon and then back again

Same old day Same situation

My happiness rears back as if to say



I wanna stay home today

Don't wanna go out

If anyone comes to play

Gonna get thrown out

I wanna stay home today

Don't want no company

No way

Yeah, yeah, yeah



I wanna stay home, stay home, stay home.........





I get such a thrill when you look in my eyes

My heart skips a beat

Girl, I feel so alive

Please tell me, baby, if all this is true

'Cause deep down inside all I wanted was you

Oh-oh-oh

Makes me wanna dance

Oh-oh-oh

It's a new romance

Oh-oh-oh

I look into your eyes

Oh-oh-oh

The best years of our lives

When we first met

I could hardly believe

The things that would happen 

and we could achieve

So let's be together

for all of our time

Oh, girl, I'm so thankful

that you are still mine

You always consider me

like an ugly duckling

And treat me like a Nostradamus

was why I had to get my shine on

I break a little something

to keep my mind on

'Cause you had my mind gone

Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh

Turn the lights on, Come on, baby

Let's just rewind the song

'Cause all I want to do is 

make the rest years the best years

All night long



Oh-oh-oh

Makes me wanna dance

Makes me wanna dance

Oh-oh-oh

It's a new romance

It's a new romance

Oh-oh-oh

I look into your eyes

Oh, yeah, yeah

I look into your eyes

Oh-oh-oh

The best years of our lives

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..............





Everything looks bright

Standing in your light

Everything feels right

What's left is out of sight

What's a girl to do 

I'm telling you

You're on my mind

I wanna be with you

'Cause when you're

standin' next to me

It's like wow

And all your kisses

seem to set me free

It's like wow

And when we touch

it's such a rush

I can't get enough

It's like- - It's like

Ooh-ooh

Hey, what

It's like wow

Ooh-ooh, hey

Hey, yeah

It's like wow

Everything is looking

right now, right now

It's like wow

And I got this feeling

This feeling 

it's just like wow

It's just like wow

You are all I'm thinking of.

Like wow

Everything feels right

Everything feels right

Like wow

Everything looks bright

All my senses are right

Like wow

Everything feels right

Baby, baby, baby

the way I'm feeling you

Is like wow



There is something

that I see

In the way 

you look at me

There's a smile

There's a truth

In your eyes

What an unexpected way

On this unexpected day

Could it be

This is where I belong

It is you I have loved

All long

There's no more mystery

It is finally clear to me

You're the home

my heart's searched for

So long

It is you I have loved

All long

Whoa, over and over

I'm filled with emotion

As I look

Into your perfect face

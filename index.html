      <p><center>Bee Movie Script
      <p><center>According to all known laws
      of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- THAT GIRL WAS HOT.
- SHE'S MY COUSIN!

  
- SHE IS?
- YES, WE'RE ALL COUSINS.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"YOU LIKE JAZZ?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

  
But don't kill no more bugs!

  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The bees!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more bee beards!

  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our yogurt night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
Bees have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Bees must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?

  
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

  
You boys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase number 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using laser beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You mean like this?

  
Bears kill bees!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little bee!

  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing bees!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the bees

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke.

  
Right. Bees don't smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story about...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a bee smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what nature intended for us?

  
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
Free the bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
The court finds in favor of the bees!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could do it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You know what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
Barry, how much honey is out there?

  
All right. One at a time.

  
Barry, who are you wearing?

  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

  
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

  
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

  
every last drop.

  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

  
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

  
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

  
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Oan't breathe.

  
Bring it in, boys!

  
Hold it right there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

  
Shut down honey production!

  
Stop making honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What do we do now?

  
Oannonball!

  
We're shutting honey production!

  
Mission abort.

  
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

  
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's going on? Where is everybody?

  
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

  
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

  
At least we got our honey back.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I thought their lives would be better!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the half of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't look very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose fault do you think that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

  
Bees?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

  
That's our whole SAT test right there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's no more pollination,

  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

  
I know this is also partly my fault.

  
How about a suicide pact?

  
How do we do it?

  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

  
I had to open my mouth and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

  
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

  
I know. Me neither.

  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

  
Roses!

  
Vanessa!

  
Roses?!

  
Barry?

  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, bees, pollen!

  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

  
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

  
Oould you slow down?

  
Barry!

  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it kind of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

  
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

  
- Bees.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

  
Security will be tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

  
Official floral business. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

  
Thank you. It was a gift.

  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

  
How about The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

  
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

  
Let's see what this baby'll do.

  
Hey, what are you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

  
Would you remove your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

  
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

  
I think this is gonna work.

  
It's got to work.

  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

  
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

  
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

  
Be careful.

  
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

  
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

  
Bee!

  
Don't freak out! My entire species...

  
What are you doing?

  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, Barry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

  
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

  
And please hurry!

  
What happened here?

  
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

  
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

  
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

  
No one's flying the plane!

  
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

  
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

  
Where's the pilot?

  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

  
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

  
As a matter of fact, there is.

  
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

  
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

  
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

  
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

  
I can't fly a plane.

  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

  
How hard could it be?

  
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

  
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

  
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

  
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

  
That's Barry!

  
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

  
and an incapacitated flight crew.

  
Flowers?!

  
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

  
with absolutely no flight experience.

  
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

  
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

  
They've done enough damage.

  
But isn't he your only hope?

  
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

  
Their wings are too small...

  
Haven't we heard this a million times?

  
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

  
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

  
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

  
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

  
But let me tell you about a small job.

  
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

  
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

  
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

  
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

  
We get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

  
Left, right, down, hover.

  
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

  
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

  
Barry, what happened?!

  
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

  
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

  
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

  
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

  
Move out!

  
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

  
Don't have to yell.

  
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

  
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

  
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

  
I can't do this!

  
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

  
You snap out of it.

  
You snap out of it.

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

  
How is the plane flying?

  
I don't know.

  
Hello?

  
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

  
The Pollen Jocks!

  
They do get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

  
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

  
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

  
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

  
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

  
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

  
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

  
Bring the nose down.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

  
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

  
Affirmative!

  
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

  
Land on that flower!

  
Ready? Full reverse!

  
Spin it around!

  
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

  
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

  
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

  
made of millions of bees!

  
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

  
Rotate around it.

  
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

  
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

  
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

  
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

  
Aim for the center!

  
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

  
Oome on, already.

  
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

  
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

  
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

  
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

  
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

  
Listen, everyone!

  
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

  
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

  
That means this is our last chance.

  
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

  
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

  
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

  
We're bees!

  
Keychain!

  
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

  
Hold on, Barry. Here.

  
You've earned this.

  
Yeah!

  
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

  
Oh, yeah.

  
That's our Barry.

  
Mom! The bees are back!

  
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

  
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

  
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

  
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

  
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

  
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

  
I had no idea.

  
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

  
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

  
Sorry I'm late.

  
He's a lawyer too?

  
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

  
Have a great afternoon!

  
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

  
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

  
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

  
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

  
Thank you, Barry!

  
That bee is living my life!

  
Let it go, Kenny.

  
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

  
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

  
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

  
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

  
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

  
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

  
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

  
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

  
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.


    
    <p><center>Avengers:Endgame script
    <p>Can you see?
  Yeah.
 You sure?
 Mm-hmm.
How about now?
Can you see now?
All right.
Ready? Three fingers.
Nice!
 Nice throw, kiddo!
 Go.
Hey, you guys want mayo
or mustard, or both?
Who wants mayo on a hotdog?
Pardon your brothers. Two mustards, please!
Thanks, momma.
Got it.
Nate, mayo or mustard?
I want ketchup.
Mind your elbow...
Good job, Hawkeye!
Go get your arrow.
Hey, guys. Enough practice.
Soup's on.
All right. We're coming.
We're hungry.
Lila, let's go.
Lila?
Honey?
Babe?
Babe?
Babe?
Boys!
Boys?
Laura!
You don't need to do that,
because you're just
holding the position.
Come on.
That was close.
That's a goal. We're
now one a-piece.
I would like to try again.
We're tied up.
Feel the tension? It's fun.
That was terrible. Now you
have a chance to win.
And you won. Congratulations.
Fair game.
Good sport.
You had fun?
It was fun.
This thing on?
Hey, Miss Potts... Pep.
If you find this recording...
don't post it, on social media.
It's gonna be a real tear-jerker.
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.
I don't even know
if you're still...
Oh, God. I hope so...
Today is day 21... uh, 22.
You know, if it wasn't for
the existensial terror of
staring into the
literal void of space,
I'd say, I'm feeling
more better today.
The infection's run its course,
thanks to the blue meanie back there.
You'd love her. Very practical.
Only a tiny bit sadistic.
Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but
we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge
to buy ourselves, about,
48 hours of playtime.
But it's now dead in the water.
We're 1,000 lightyears
from the nearest 7-11.
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning.
That'll be it.
And Pep, I...
I know I said no
more surprises, but
I gotta say I was really hoping
to pull off one last one.
But it looks like...
Well, you know what
it looks like.
Don't feel bad about this.
I mean actually if you
grovel for a couple weeks,
and then, move on
with enormous guilt.
I should probably lie down.
I'm gonna caress my
Please know that...
When I drift off, it will be
goodbye the whole time...
I'll think about you.
Because it's always you.
 Couldn't stop him.
 Neither could I.
I lost the kid.
Tony, we lost.
Is, umm...
Oh, my God!
It's okay.
It's been 23 days since
Thanos came to Earth.
World governments are in pieces.
The parts that are still working
are trying to take a census,
And it looks like he did...
He did exactly what he said he
was gonna do. Thanos wiped out..
...fifty percent of
all living creatures.
Where is he now? Where?
We don't know.
He just opened a portal
and walked through.
What's wrong with him?
He's pissed.
He thinks he failed.
Which of course he did, but there's a
lot of that goin' around, ain't there?
Honestly, at this exact second, I
thought you were a Build-A-Bear.
Maybe I am.
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.
Deep space scans, and
satellites, and we got nothing.
 Tony you fought him.
 Who told you that?
Didn't fight him.
No. He wiped my face
with a planet while a
Bleecker Street magician
gave away the stone.
 That's what happened. There was no fight...
 Okay.
Did he give you any clues?
Any coordinates, anything?
Pfft!
I saw this coming a few years back. I had
a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.
Thought I was dreaming.
- Tony I'm gonna need you to focus.
- And I needed you.
As in past tense. That trumps what
you need. It's too late, buddy.
Sorry.
You know what I need?
I need to shave.
- And I believe I rememeber telling
- Tony, Tony, Tony...
why that otherwise,
that what we needed was a suit of armor
around the world. Remember that?
Whether it impacted our precious
freedoms, or not. That's what we needed.
- Well that didn't work out, did it?
- I said we'd lose.
You said, "We'll do
that together, too."
Well guess what, Cap? We lost.
You weren't there.
But that's what we do, right?
Our best work after the fact?
We're the Avengers? We're the Avengers?
Not the Prevengers?
Okay. You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?
- No, no. Here's my... She's great, by the way.
- Tony, sit, sit down!
We need you. You're new blood.
Bunch of tired old mills...
I got nothing for you, Cap.
I got no coordinates,
no clues, no strategies,
no options...
Zero. Zip. Nada. No
trust, you liar...
Here, take this. You find
him and you put that on.
You hide.
- Tony!
- I'm fine. I...
Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna
probably be out for the rest of the day.
You guys take care of him. And I'll bring
an Bezurian elixir when I come back.
- Where are you going?
- To kill Thanos.
Hey.
You know we usually work
as a team here, and
between you and I we're
also a little fragile.
We realize up there is more your
territory but this is our fight, too.
- You even know where he is?
- I know people who might.
Don't bother.
I can tell you where Thanos is.
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.
Then when he worked, he
talked about his great plan.
Even disassembled, I
wanted to please him.
I'd ask, where would we go
once his plan was complete?
His answer was always the same.
To The Garden.
That's cute. Thanos has
a retirement plan.
So where is he, then?
When Thanos snapped his fingers,
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.
No one's ever seen anything like it...
until two days ago.
On this planet.
Thanos is there.
He used the stones again.
Hey, hey, hey...
We'd be going in
short-handed, you know?
- Look, he still got the stones, so...
- So let's get him.
- We use them to bring everyone back.
- Just like that?
Yeah. Just like that.
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?
Because before, you
didn't have me.
Hey, new girl, everybody in this
room is about that superhero life.
And if you don't mind my asking, where
the hell have you been all this time?
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.
And unfortunately, they
didn't have you guys.
I like this one.
Let's go get this ().
Okay. Who here hasn't
been to space?
You better not throw
up on my ship.
Approaching jump in 3.. 2.. 1.
I'll head down for recon.
- This is gonna work Steve.
- I know it will.
Because I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.
No satellites, no ships, no armies,
no ground defenses of any kind.
It's just him.
Then that's enough.
Oh, no.
Where are they?
Answer the question.
The universe
required correction.
After that, the stones served
no purpose, beyond temptation.
You murdered trillions!
You should be grateful.
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.
I used the stones to
destroy the stones.
It nearly killed me.
But the work is done.
It always will be.
I am inevitable.
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying.
My father is many things.
A liar is not one of them.
Thank you, Daughter.
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...
What... what did you do?
I went for the head.
So I, uh...
Went on a date the other day.
It's the first time in five years,
you know? Sit there, dinner...
I didn't know what
to talk about.
What did you talk about?
Same old crap, you know? How
things have changed, and...
My job, his job....
How much we miss the Mets.
Then things get quiet..
He cried as they were
serving the salads.
What about you?
I cried just before dessert.
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...
That's great.
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump, you
didn't know where you
were gonna come down.
And that's it. That's those little
brave baby steps you gotta take.
To try and become whole again.
To try and find purpose.
I went in the ice in '45 right
after I met the love of my life.
Woke up 70 years later.
You got to move on.
Got to move on.
The world is in our hands.
It's left to us guys.
And we got to do
something with it.
Otherwise...
Thanos should've
killed all of us.
What the hell?
Hope?
Kid! Hey, kid!
What the hell happened here?
My God...
No. Please. Please, please.
No, no, no...
Excuse me. Sorry.
No, Cassie, no.
No.
No, no.
Please, please,
please, please....
No, Cassie...
What?
Cassie?
Dad?
You're so big!
Yeah, we boarded that highly
suspect warship Danvers pinged.
It was an infectious
garbage scowl.
So, thanks for the hot tip.
- Well, you were closer.
- Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.
You get a reading
on those tremors?
It was a mild subduction
under the African plate.
Do we have a visual? How
are we handling it?
Nat, it's an earthquake
under the ocean.
We handle it by not handling it.
Carol, are we seeing
you here next month?
- Not likely.
- What, you gonna get another haircut?
Listen, fur-face. I'm
covering a lot of territory.
The things that are
happening on Earth are
happening everywhere, on
thousands of planets.
That's a good point.
That's a good point.
So you might not see
me for a long time.
All right. Uh, well...
This channel is always active.
So, anything goes sideways...
Anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...
- Comes through me.
- Okay.
All right.
Good luck.
- Where are you?
- Mexico.
The federales found a
room full of bodies.
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never
even had the chance to get their guns off.
- It's probably a rival gang...
- Except it isn't.
It's definitely Barton.
What he's done here, what he's
been doing for the last few years,
I mean, the scene
that he left...
I gotta tell you, there's a part of
me that doesn't even wanna find him.
Will you find out where
he's going next?
Nat...
Please.
Okay.
You know I'd offer to clip your dinner
but you seem pretty miserable already.
You here to do your laundry?
And to see a friend.
Clearly, your friend is fine.
You know I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming up the bridge.
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships, cleaner water.
You know, if you're about to tell
me to look on the bright side...
Um...
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.
Sorry. Force of habit.
You know I keep telling everybody
they should move on and... grow.
Some do.
But not us.
- If I move on, who does this?
- Maybe it doesn't need to be done.
I used to have nothing.
And then I got this.
This job.
This family.
And I was... I was
better because of it.
And even though...
they're gone...
Now, I'm still
trying to be better.
I think we both
need to get a life.
You first.
Oh... Hi. Hi!
Is anyone home?
This is Scott Lang.
We met a few years ago, at the airport?
In Germany?
I got really big and
I had my mask on.
- You wouldn't recognize me.
- Is this an old message?
Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I
know you know that.
It's the front gate.
I need to talk to you guys.
Scott.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Have either of you guys ever
studied quantum physics?
Only in mid-conversation.
Alright. So...
Five years ago, right before...
Thanos,
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.
The quantum realm is like its
own microscopic universe.
To get in there, you have to be
incredibly small. Hope, she's my...
She... she was my...
She was supposed to pull me out.
And then Thanos happened, and
- I got stuck in there.
- Sorry. That must've been a long 5 years.
Yeah, but that's just it.
It wasn't.
For me it was five hours.
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.
Everything is unpredictable. Is that
anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.
Scott.
What are you talking about?
So...
What I'm saying is...
Time works differently
in the quantum realm.
The only problem is right now, we
don't have a way to navigate it.
But what if we did?
I can't stop thinking about it. What
if we could somehow control the chaos,
and we could navigate it? What if
there was a way that we can enter
the quantum realm at a certain
point in time but then
exit the quantum realm at
another point in time? Like...
Like before Thanos.
Wait, are you talking
about a time machine?
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.
It's more like a...
Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy.
It's crazy.
But I can't stop thinking about it.
There's gotta be...
Some wa... It's crazy.
I get e-mails from a raccoon. So,
nothing sounds crazy anymore.
So who do we talk to about this?
Chow-time!
Morgoona.
Morgan H. Stark.
Want some lunch?
- Define lunch or be disintegrated.
- Okay.
You should not be
wearing that, okay?
That is part of a special anniversary
gift I'm making for Mom.
There you go. Are you
thinking about lunch?
Want a handful of crickets?
- No.
- That's what you want.
- How did you find this?
- Garage.
Really?
- Were you looking for it?
- No.
I found it, though.
You like going to the garage, huh?
So does Daddy.
It's fine actually. Mom never
wears anything I wear.
Now, we know what
it sounds like...
Tony after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible...
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale,
which then triggers the Deutsch
proposition. Can we agree on that?
Thank you.
In Layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.
- I did.
- No.
You accidentally survived. It's a---
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?
- A time heist?
- Yeah. Time heist.
Of course. Why didn't we
think of this before?
Oh! Because it's laughable?
Because it's a pipedream?
The stones are in the past. We
can go back and we can get them.
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?
I don't believe we would.
Gotta say this. Sometimes, I
miss that giddy optimism.
However, high hopes won't
help if there's no logical,
tangible, way for me to safely
execute said time heist.
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.
That means no talking to our past selves,
no betting on sporting events...
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.
Are you seriously telling
me that your plan to
save the universe is based
on Back to the Future?
- No.
- Good. You had me worried there.
'Cause that'd be (). That's
not how quantum physics works.
Tony...
We have to take a stand.
We did stand. And
yet, here we are.
I know you got a lot on the line.
You got a wife, a daughter.
But I lost someone very important to me.
A lot of people did.
And now, now, we have a chance to bring
her back. To bring everyone back.
And you're telling me
that you won't even...
That's right, Scott.
I won't. Leave it.
Got a kid.
Mommy told me to
come and save you.
Good job. I'm saved.
I wish you'd come here to
ask me something else.
Anything else. Honestly, I
missed you guys, it was...
- Oh, and table's set for six.
- Tony, I get it.
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.
But this is a second chance.
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.
I can't roll the dice again.
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.
- He's scared.
- He's not wrong.
Yeah, but I mean,
what are we gonna do?
We need him. What,
are we gonna stop?
No. I wanna do it right.
We're gonna need a
really big brain.
Bigger than his?
Come on. I feel like I'm the only
one eating. Try some of that.
Have some eggs.
I'm so confused.
- These are confusing times.
- Right. No, no...
- That's not what I meant. I...
- No, I get it.
I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy.
- I'm wearing shirts now.
- Yeah! How? Why?
Five years ago we
got our asses beat.
Except it was worse for me.
Because I lost twice.
First, Hulk lost. Then Banner lost.
Then, we all lost.
- No one blamed you, Bruce.
- I did.
For years I've been
treating the Hulk like he's
some kind of disease,
something to get rid of.
But then I started looking
at him as the cure.
Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put
the brains and the brawn together.
And now look at me.
Best of both worlds.
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes?
- Can we get a photo?
- 100%, little person.
Come on, step on up. You mind?
Oh.
- Say "green."
- Green.
Greeeen.
- Did you get that?
- That's good.
Don't you wanna grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.
- Nobody does.
- Wait, no, no, he wants to...
You want to take a
picture with him, right?
He's even saying no he doesn't.
I get it.
I don't want it either. I don't
want a picture with them.
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.
- They said they'd do it.
- I don't want it anymore.
- You'd feel bad...
- Take the () phone.
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
No, it's great, kids.
Thank you very much.
- Hulk out!
- Bruce.
- Dab.
- Bruce.
Listen to your Mom.
She knows better.
- About we were saying...
- Right.
The whole time travel do-over?
Guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.
Well, you pulled this off.
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.
Look at a mod inspiration,
let me see what checks out.
So, recommend one last sim before
we pack it in for the night.
This time, in the shape of a
mobius strip, inverted. Please?
Processing...
Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle
factoring, and spectral decomp.
- Gotta take a second.
- Just a moment.
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...
Model rendered.
()!
()!
What are you doing
up, Little Miss?
- ().
- No. We don't say that.
Only Mommy says that word. She
coined it, it belongs to her.
Why you up?
'Cause I got some important ()
going on here. What do you think?
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.
- Was it Juice Pops?
- Sure was.
That's extortion.
Great minds think alike. Juice
Pops, exactly was on...
my mind.
You done? Yeah? Now you are.
- That face, goes there.
- Tell me a story.
A story.
Once upon a time, a little
girl went to bed. The end.
That ain't the whole story.
Come on, that's your
favorite story.
I love you tons.
I love you 3,000.
Wow.
3,000. That's crazy.
Go to bed. Or I'll
sell all your toys.
Night-night.
Not that it's a competition,
but she loves me 3,000.
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.
- What you reading?
- Just a book on composting.
What's new with composting?
- Just ....
- I figured it out...
by the way.
You know, just so we're talking
about the same thing...
Time travel.
What?
Wow.
That's...
Amazing, and.... terrifying.
That's right.
- I got really lucky.
- Yeah. I know.
- A lot of people didn't.
- No, I can't help everybody.
- It sorta seems like you can.
- Not if I stop.
I can put a pin in it
right now, and stop.
Tony...
trying to get you to stop has been one
of the few failures of my entire life.
I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked
box and drop it at the bottom of a lake...
...go to bed.
But would you be able to rest?
Okay, here we go. Time
travel test number one.
Scott, fire up the, uhh...
The van thing.
Breakers are set. Emergency
generators are on standby.
Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't
wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's.
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.
You can't say things like that.
Just... it was, just a bad joke.
- You were kidding, right?
- I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.
We're good! Get your helmet on.
Scott, I'm gonna send you
back a week, but you'll walk
around for an hour, then bring
you back in 10 seconds.
- Makes sense?
- Perfectly not confusing.
Good luck, Scott. You got this.
You're right. I do,
Captain America.
On the count of three.
3.. 2.. 1..
Guys? This doesn't feel right.
- What's going on? Hold on.
- Who is that?
- Is that Scott?
- Yes, it's Scott!
Ooh! My back!
- Can you bring him back?
- I'm working on it!
A baby.
- It's Scott.
- As a baby!
Bring Scott back.
When I say kill the
power, kill the power.
And... kill it!
Somebody peed my pants.
I don't know if it was
"baby" me or "old" me.
Or, just "me" me.
Time travel!
What?
I see this as an absolute win.
Why the long face?
Let me guess. He
turned into a baby.
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?
That's the EPR paradox.
Instead of pushing Lang through time, you
might've wound up pushing time through Lang.
It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody
coulda cautioned you against it.
- You did.
- Oh, did I?
Thank God, I'm here.
Regardless, I fixed it.
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.
I just want peace.
Turns out, resentment is
corrosive, and I hate it.
Me, too.
We got a shot at getting
these stones, but I
gotta tell you my
priority is to bring back
what we lost? I hope, yes.
Keep what I found? I
have to, at all costs.
And, maybe not die
trying will be nice.
Sounds like a deal.
- Tony, I don't know...
- Why? He made it for you.
Plus, honestly I have to get it out the
garage before Morgan takes it sledding.
Thank you, Tony.
Will you keep that a little quietly?
Didn't bring one for the whole team.
- We are getting, the whole team, yeah?
- We're working on that right now.
- Hey, humie! Where's big green?
- Kitchen. I think.
- That's awesome.
- Rodent, careful on re-entry.
There's an idiot on
the landing zone.
Oh, God!
What's up, regular-sized man?
Kind of a step down from a golden palace
for an Avenger highness or whatnot.
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.
First, they've lost Asgard,
then half the people. They're probably
just happy they have a home.
You shouldn't have come!
Valkyrie!
Great to see you, Angry Girl.
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.
- This is Rocket.
- How you doin'?
- He won't see you.
- That bad, huh?
We only see him once a month,
when he comes in for...
...supplies.
- It's that bad.
- Yeah.
What the...
Woo! Something died in here.
Hello? Thor?
Are you here about the cable?
The Cinemax ran out two weeks ago,
and, sports were all kind of fuzzy...
Boys! Oh, my God!
My God! How have you been?
Come here, you little rascal!
No, I'm good! I'm good.
That's not necessary!
Hulk, you know my friends,
Miek, Korg, right?
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys. Long time no see.
Beer's on the bucket. Feel
free to log on to the wi-fi.
No password, obviously.
Thor, he's back. That kid on the TV
who's called me a () again.
- Noobmaster.
- Yeah, Noobmaster69.
Noobmaster. Hey, it's Thor again.
You know, the God of Thunder?
Listen, buddy. If you don't log off
this game immediately I'm gonna fly
home to your house, come down to
that basement you're hiding in,
rip off your arms then
shove them up your butt!
Oh, that's right. Yes, go cry to
your father, you little weasel!
Thank you, Thor.
Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?
Thank you very much. I will.
So you guys want a drink?
What are you drinking?
We have beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.
Buddy, you all right?
Yes, I'm fine! Why,
don't I look all right?
You look like melted ice cream.
So, what's up?
We need your help. There might be
a chance we could fix everything.
What, like the cable? 'Cause that's
been driving me bananas for weeks.
Like Thanos.
Don't say that name.
Um, yeah. We don't actually
say that name in here.
Please take your hand off me.
Now, I know that...
guy might scare you.
Why would I be? Why would, why
would I be scared of that guy?
I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?
Anyone else here
killed that guy?
Nope. Didn't think so.
Korg, why don't you, tell everybody
who chopped Thanos' big head off.
Umm... Stormbreaker?
Now, who's swinging
Stormbreaker?
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?
I've been there myself.
You wanna know who
helped me out of it?
I don't know. Is it... Natasha?
It was you.
You helped me.
Why don't you ask the,
Asgardians down there,
how much my help was worth.
The ones that are left, anyway.
I think we can bring them back.
Stop. Just, stop...
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in
my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and
and saved. But I'm fine, okay?
We're fine, aren't we?
Nah, all good here, mate!
So, whatever it is that
you're offering, we're
not into it, don't care,
couldn't care less.
Goodbye.
We need you, pal.
There's beer on the ship.
What kind?
It's him! He's after Akihiko!
We never did anything to you!
You're done hurting people.
You're crazy!
Wait! Help me!
What I want...
You can't give me.
You shouldn't be here.
Neither should you.
I've got a job to do.
Is that what you're
calling this?
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.
We found something.
A chance, maybe...
Don't.
Don't what?
Don't give me hope.
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.
Drifting left. On the
side there, Lebowski.
- Ratchet, how's it going?
- It's Rocket.
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.
Yup.
Time travel suit? Not bad.
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy!
- I'm being very careful.
- No, you're being very Hulky.
- I'm being careful.
- These are Pym particles, all right?
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped
out of existence, this is it.
This is what we have. We're
not making any more.
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.
We've got enough for
one round trip, each.
That's it. No do-overs.
Plus, two test runs.
One test run.
All right. I'm not
ready for this.
I'm game.
I'll do it.
Clint, now you're gonna feel
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.
Don't worry about it.
Wait a second, let me
ask you something.
If we can do this, you know, go
back in time, why don't we just
find baby Thanos, you know?
And...
- First of all, that's horrible.
- It's Thanos.
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.
Changing the past doesn't change the future.
Look, we go back, we get the
stones before Thanos gets them...
Thanos doesn't have the stones.
Problem solved.
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.
- Well, that's what I heard.
- What? By who? Who told you that?
Star Trek, Terminator,
TimeCop, Time After Time,
- Quantum Leap.
- A Wrinkle in Time,
- Somewhere in Time,
- Hot Tub Time Machine.
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically,
any movie that deals with time travel.
Die Hard? No, it's not...
This is known.
I don't know why everyone believes
that, but that isn't true.
Think about it: If you travel to the
past, that past becomes your future.
And your former present
becomes the past.
Which can't now be changed
by your new future...
Exactly.
So Back to the Future's
a bunch of ()?
All right, Clint. We're going in 3..
2.. 1...
Cooper?
- Where are my headphones?
- Lila?
Lila! No!
Dad?
Dad?
Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?
Yeah.
It worked.
It worked.
Okay, so the "how" works.
Now we gotta figure out the
"when," and the "where."
Almost everyone in this
room has had an encounter
with at least one of the
six Infinity Stones.
Well, I'd subtitute the
word 'encounter' for '()
near been killed by one of
the six Infinity Stones.'
I haven't. I don't even know what
the hell you're all talking about.
Regardless, we only have enough Pym
Particles for one round trip each,
and these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.
So. Let's start
with the Aether.
Thor, what do you know?
Is he asleep?
Where to start? Umm...
The Aether, first,
is not a stone.
Someone's called it a stone before.
Ahem...
It's more of a... an angry
sludge, sort of thing. So...
Someone's gonna need to amend
that, and stop saying that.
Here's an interesting
story, though.
About the Aether. My
grandafther, many years
ago, had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.
Scary beings. So Jane...
Oh, there she is. That's Jane...
She's... an old flame of mine.
She... she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...
and then the Aether stuck
itself inside her.
And, she became very, very sick.
So I had to take her to
Asgard, which is where I'm from.
And we had to try and fix her.
We were dating at the time, you see. I
got to introduce her to my Mother...
who's dead, and umm....
Oh, you know. Jane and I aren't
even dating anymore, so...
These things happen though, you know.
Nothing lasts forever.
- The only thing that...
- Why don't you come sit down.
I'm not done yet. The only thing that
is permanent in life, is impermanence.
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.
Quill said he stole the
Power Stone from Morag.
- Is that a person?
- Morag's a planet.
Quill was a person.
Like a planet? Like
in outer space?
Oh, look. It's like a little
puppy, all happy and everything.
Do you wanna go to space? You
wanna go to space, puppy?
I'll take you to space.
- Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
- What is Vormir?
A dominion of death, at the very
center of Celestial existence.
It's where... Thanos
murdered my sister.
Noted.
- That Time Stone guy...
- Doctor Strange.
Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?
- Neurostuff meets rabbit from a hat.
- Nice place in the village, though.
- Yeah. Sullivan Street.
- Hmm... Bleecker.
Wait, he lived in New York?
- No. He lived in Toronto.
- Yeah, not Bleecker. It's Sullivan.
Guys, if you pick the right year,
there are three stones in New York.
Shut the front door!
All right. We have a plan.
Six stones, three
teams, one shot.
Five years ago, we lost.
All of us.
We lost friends...
We lost family...
We lost a part of ourselves.
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.
You know your teams, you
know your missions.
Get the stones, get them back.
One round trip each. No mistakes.
No do-overs.
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.
But it doesn't mean we
should know what to expect.
Be careful. Look out
for each other.
This is the fight of our lives.
And we're gonna win.
Whatever it takes.
Good luck.
- He's pretty good at that.
- Right?
All right. You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, jelly green.
Tractors engaged.
You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Okay.
- I'll do my best.
- As promises go, that was pretty lame.
See you in a minute.
All right, we all have our assignments.
Two stones uptown, one stone, down.
Stay low. Keep an
eye on the clock.
Feel free to smash if
things don't go your way.
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.
I'd be careful going that way.
We just had the floors waxed.
Ma'am, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.
You're about... five
years too early.
Stephen Strange is currently performing
surgery about twenty blocks that way.
What do you want from him?
That, actually.
Ah.
- I'm afraid not.
- Sorry, but I wasn't asking.
- You don't wanna do this.
- You're right. I don't.
But I need that stone, and
I don't have time to...
Let's start over, shall we?
That's Jane.
All right.
Here's the deal, Tubby:
You're gonna charm her and I'm
gonna poke her with this thing
and extract the Reality Stone
and get gone, lickety-split.
I'll be right back, okay? There's a
wine cellar, that's just down there.
My father used to fish
with a barrel of ale.
- I'll see if the cellar has a couple of...
- Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?
Who's the fancy broad?
It's my Mother.
She dies today.
Oh. That's today?
I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.
This was a bad idea.
- Come here.
- No, no, no. I think I'm having...
- I'm having a panic attack.
- Come here. Right here.
You think you're the only one who lost
people? What do you think we're doing here?
I lost the only
family I ever had.
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick
with the antenna, all gone.
Now, I get you miss your Mom.
But she's gone. Really gone.
And there are plenty of people
who are only kinda gone.
But you can help them.
So is it too much to ask that you
brush the crumbs outta your beard,
make schmoopy talk to Pretty
Pants, and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone and
help me get my family back?
Okay.
- Are you crying?
- No...
Yes!
Get it together!
You can do this.
You can do this.
All right?
- Yes, I can.
- Good.
I can do this.
I can't do this.
Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone.
This is our shot.
Thor?
Thor!
Alright. Bring it down low.
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.
Hey, can we hurry it up?
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.
All that, is really helpful.
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.
Take that stone and come back.
No messing around.
- Hey.
- You got this.
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.
See you back.
You guys watch each other's six.
Yeah.
The coordinates for
Vormir are laid in.
All they have to do
is not fall out.
We're a long way from Budapest.
Okay, so, uhh...
We just wait around for this
Quill guy to show up and
then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?
Let's take cover.
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.
Wait a minute, what are
you talking about right
now? Who else is looking
for these stones?
My father, my sister...
- and me.
- And you?
Where are you right now?
- You're welcome.
- I didn't ask for your help.
And yet, you always need it.
Get up.
- Father wants us back on the ship.
- Why?
He's found an Infinity Stone.
- Where?
- On a planet called Morag.
Father's plan is
finally in motion.
- One stone isn't six, Nebula.
- It's a start.
If he gets all of them...
Ronan's located the Power Stone.
I'm dispatching you to his ship.
- He won't like that.
- His alternative is death, then.
Ronan's obsession
clouds his judgement.
We will not fail you, Father.
No, you won't.
I swear...
I will make you proud.
We just, wait around for
this Quill guy to show up,
and then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?
Let's take cover.
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.
- Who was that?
- I don't know...
My head is splitting...
I don't know...
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.
Bring her to my ship.
Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like
they're just about wrapped up here.
Got it. I'm approaching
the elevator now.
If it's all the same to you...
I'll have that drink now.
All right. Good one. No standing around,
I'm closing up this door for later.
By the way, feel
free to clean up.
Ugh, Mr. Rogers. I almost
forgot that that suit
- did nothing for your ass.
- No one asked you to look.
I think you look great, Cap.
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.
- Uhh, magic wand?
- STRIKE team's coming to secure it.
We can take that
off your hands.
By all means.
- Careful with that thing!
- Unless you want your mind erased.
- Not in a fun way.
- We promise to be careful.
- Who are these guys?
- They are SHIELD...
Well, actually Hydra. But,
we didn't know that yet.
Seriously, you didn't? I mean...
they look like bad guys.
You're small, but
you're talking loud.
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue.
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue!
I mean, honestly! How do
you think you'll be...
Shut up.
All right, you're up, little buddy.
There's our stone.
Alright. Flick me.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
- Hey! Buddy.
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.
- Take the stairs!
- Yeah. Stop. Stop!
Take the stairs.
Take the stairs!
All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the
elevator just passing the 80th floor.
On it.
- Head to the lobby.
- Alright. I'll see you there.
Evidence secure. We're
en route to Dr. List.
No. No hitches at all, Mr.
Secretary.
Captain. I thought you were
coordinating search and rescue?
Change of plans.
Hey, Cap.
Rumlow.
I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm
gonna be running point on the scepter.
Sir? I don't understand.
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.
Sorry, Cap.
I can't give you the scepter.
- I'm gonna have to call the Director.
- That's okay. Trust me.
Hail Hydra.
So many stairs!
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.
- It is go-time.
- Bombs away.
Is, is that Axe body spray?
Yeah, I had a can just
for emergencies. Relax.
- Can we focus, please?
- I'm going inside you. Now.
May I ask you
where you're going?
To lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are?
Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one
of the folks behind Nick Fury.
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.
I'm gonna have to ask you to
turn that prisoner over to me.
- Loki will be answering to Odin himself.
- Oh, he's gonna answer to us.
Odin can have what's left. And
I'm gonna need that case.
That's been SHIELD property
for over 70 years.
Hand over the case, Stark.
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things
are getting dicey up here. Let's go.
I'm not gonna argue who's got the
higher authority here, all right?
You promise me you won't die?
You're only giving me a
mild cardiac dysrythmia.
That doesn't sound mild.
I need the case.
I know you got a lotta pull.
I'm just saying...
Okay. Then give me the case.
Do it, Lang!
- Get your hands off!
- Window's closing. Pull my pin!
Here goes!
- Stark?
- Stark!
Look, he's convulsing.
Give him air!
- Medic!
- Medic!
You got some help!
Stark, you--- your
chest machine?
Breathe! Breathe!
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.
No stairs!
You'll be fine, Stark.
Stay with us!
I'll try something, okay? I have
no idea if it's gonna work.
Yes!
That worked a treat.
That was so crazy!
I had no idea if
that was gonna work.
- The case...
- The case. It's, uhh...
Where's the case? Where's Loki?
Loki!
- That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?
- Oh, we blew it.
Loki!?
Tony, what's going on?
Tell me you found that cube.
Oh, you gotta be () me.
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.
I'm not Loki.
And I don't wanna hurt you.
I can do this all day.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Where did you get this?
Bucky... is... alive!
What?
That is America's ass.
- Please, please!
- I'm sorry. I can't help you, Bruce.
If I give up the Time Stone to help
your reality, I'm dooming my own.
With all due respect, I'm not sure
the science really supports that.
The Infinity Stones create what you
experience as the flow of time.
Remove one of the stones,
and that flow splits.
Now this may benefit your reality.
But my new one, not so much.
In this new branched reality, without our
chief weapon against the forces of darkness,
our world will be overrun.
Millions will suffer.
So, tell me, doctor, can your
science prevent all that?
No. But we can erase it.
Because once we're done with the stones, we
can return each one into its own timeline
at the moment it was taken.
So, chronologically...
In that reality....
it never left.
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.
In order to return the
stones, you have to survive.
We will. I will. I promise.
I can't risk this
reality on a promise.
It's the duty, of the Sorcerer
Supreme to protect the Time Stone.
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?
- What did you say?
- Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.
- Willingly?
- Yes.
- Why?
- I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.
Or I did.
Strange was meant to
be the best of us.
So he must've done
it for a reason.
I fear you might be right.
Thank you.
I'm counting on you, Bruce.
We all are.
Run diagnostics.
Show me her memory file.
Sire, the file appears entangled.
It was a memory, but not hers.
There's another consciousness
sharing her network.
Another Nebula.
Impossible.
This duplicate carries a time stamp...
from nine years in the future.
Where is this other Nebula?
In our solar system.
On Morag.
- Can you access her?
- Yes. The two are linked.
Search the duplicate's
memories, for Infinity Stones.
And these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.
Freeze image.
Terrans.
Avengers.
Unruly wretches. What's
that reflection?
Amplify this, Maw.
I don't understand.
- Two Nebulas.
- No. The same Nebula.
From two different times.
Set course for Morag. Scan
the duplicate's memories.
I want to see everything.
My ladies, I'll see you after.
Go on.
- What are you doing?
- Ahh!
You're better off leaving the
sneaking to your brother.
Yeah, I was simply just
going for a walk, and uh...
What are you wearing?
I always wear this. This
is one of my favorites.
What's wrong with your eye?
Oh, my eye. That's... you
remember the Battle of Haroquin?
When I got hit in the
face with a broadsword?
You're not the Thor I
know at all, are you?
Yes, I am.
The future hasn't been
kind to you, has it?
I didn't say I'm
from the future.
I was raised by witches, boy.
I see with more than
eyes, and you know that.
I am totally, totally
from the future!
Yes, you are.
- I really need to talk to you.
- We can talk.
His head was over there...
His body over there...
What was the point.
I was too late.
I was just standing there.
- Some idiot with an ax.
- You're no idiot.
You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel
from the wisest person in Asgard.
- I guess, yeah.
- Idiot? No.
- A failure? Absolutely.
- That's a little bit harsh.
You do know what
that makes you?
Just like everyone else.
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?
Everyone fails at who they
are supposed to be, Thor.
The measure of a
person, of a hero
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.
I really missed you, Mum.
Thor! I got it!
Get that rabbit!
- Ma, I have to tell you something.
- No, son. You don't.
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.
- But this is about your future.
- It's none of my business.
Hey.
You must be Mom.
I got the thing. Come
on, we got to move.
- I wish we had more time.
- This was a gift.
And you're going to be the
man you're meant to be.
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.
And eat a salad.
- Come on. We gotta go.
- Goodbye.
- Three... two...
- No, wait!
Wh- what am I looking at?
Oh, sometimes it takes a second.
I'm still worthy.
Oh, boy.
Goodbye, Mom.
So he's an idiot?
What's that?
The tool of a thief.
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...
This is the part where spikes come out,
with skeletons on the end and everything...
What are you talking about?
When you break into a place called
the temple of the Power Stone,
There's gonna be a bunch of booby
traps--- Okay. All right. Go ahead.
I wasn't always like this.
Me either.
But we work with
what we got, right?
Sync up.
Three.. two.. one...
You murdered trillions!
You should be grateful.
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.
I used the stones to destroy the stones.
It nearly killed me.
But the work is done.
It always will be.
I am inevitable.
- What did you do to them?
- Nothing. Yet.
They're not trying to stop something
I'm going to do in our time.
They're trying to undo something
I've already done in theirs.
The stones...
I found them all.
I won.
Tipped the cosmic
scales to balance.
This is your future.
It's my destiny.
My father is many things. A
liar is not one of them.
Thank you, Daughter.
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...
And that, is destiny fulfilled.
Sire, your Daughter...
No...
...is a traitor.
That's not me. It's not. I could never...
I would never betray you. Never.
I know.
And you'll have the
chance to prove it.
No...
He knows!
Barton? Barton, come in.
Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem.
Come on!
Come in, we have a prob....
Thanos knows.
Thanos...
Cap...
Sorry, buddy.
We got a problem.
Huh. Yeah, we do.
- Well, what are we gonna do now?
- You know what, give me a break, Steve.
I just got hit in the
head with a Hulk.
You said that we had one shot.
This, this was our shot.
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing.
Six stones or nothing.
You're repeating yourself, you know that?
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.
- No!
- Come on.
You never wanted a time heist, you
went on board with the time heist...
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah!
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?
No, no, no. There's
no other options.
There's no do-overs. We're
not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left. Each.
That's it, alright? We use that...
Bye, bye. You're not going home.
Yeah, well if we don't try...
then no one else is
going home, either.
I got it.
There's another way. To retake the
Tesseract and acquire new particles.
We'll stroll down memory lane.
Military installation, Garden State.
Why were they both there?
They were there at a...I've
a vaguely exact idea.
How vague?
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?
- I know for a fact they were there...
- Who's they?
- What are we doing?
- And I know how I know.
Guys, what's up? What is it?
Well, it looks like
we're improvising.
- Right.
- What are we improvising?
Scott, get this back
to the compound.
Suit up.
What's in New Jersey?
- 0-4, 0-4...
- Uhh, 0-7.
- 0-7.
- Excuse me...
1-9-7-0.
- Are you sure?
- Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry.
America. Rogers. Look,
if you do this,
and this doesn't work,
you're not coming back.
Thanks for the pep
talk, pissant.
You trust me?
I do.
Your call.
Here we go.
Hey, man!
Make love, not war!
Clearly, you weren't
actually born here, right?
The idea of me was.
Right. Well, imagine
you're SHIELD, running a
quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization.
Where do you hide it?
In plain sight.
Good luck on your
mission, Captain.
Good luck on your
project, doctor.
You're new here?
Not exactly.
Gotcha.
Back in the game.
Arnim, you in there?
Arnim?
Hey!
The door's this way, pal.
Oh, yeah.
I'm looking for Dr. Zola.
Have you seen him?
Yeah, no, Dr. Zol... No,
I haven't seen a soul.
Pardon me.
Do I know you?
No, sir. I'm, a...
visitor from MIT.
Huh. MIT.
Got a name?
Howard.
Well that'll be
easy to remember.
Howard...
...Potts.
Well, I'm Howard Stark.
Hi.
(). Now, don't pull it.
Yeah...
You look a little green around
the gills there, Potts.
I'm fine. Just, long hours.
Wanna get some air?
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah. That would be swell.
- That way.
- Okay.
Need your briefcase?
You're not one of
those, are ya, Potts?
- Hello.
- Dr. Pym?
That would be the number
that you called. Yes.
This is Capt. Stevens
from shipping.
- We have a package for you.
- Bring it up.
Well, that's the thing, sir.
We can't.
I'm confused. I thought
that was your job.
Well, it's just... Sir,
the box is glowing and,
to be honest, some of our mail
guys aren't feeling that great.
They didn't know
better, did they?
Yeah, they did. You
better get down here.
Excuse me. Out of the way!
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You
got a big date tonight?
My wife's expecting.
And, uh... Too much
time in the office.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Hold this, will you?
Yeah, sure.
- How far along is she?
- I don't know... uh...
She's at the point where she can't
stand the sound of my chewing.
I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.
I have a little girl.
A girl would be nice. Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.
What'd be so awful about that?
Let's just say that the greater
good has rarely outweighed
my own self-interests.
- And you've never seen these 2 men before?
- No, I've got an eye for this.
- The 2 of them looked fishy.
- Can you describe them?
- Well, one of them had a hippie beard.
- Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
Definitely Mungo Jerry.
Yeah, this is Chesler. I
need every available MPs
on sub-level 6. We have
a potential breach.
So, where are you
at with names?
Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Almanzo.
Might wanna let that stew on.
You got time.
Let me ask you a question.
When your kid was born...
- were you nervous?
- Wildly. Yeah.
Did you feel qualified?
Like you had any idea how to
successfully operate that thing?
I literally pieced it
together as I went along,
I thought about what
my Dad did, and...
My old man, he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.
I thought my Dad
was tough on me.
And now, looking back, I just
remember the good stuff, you know.
- He did drop the odd pearl.
- Yeah? Like what?
"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."
Smart guy.
He did his best.
Let me tell you. That
kid's not even here yet
and, there's nothing I
wouldn't do for him.
Good to meet you, Potts.
Yeah, Howard...
Everything's gonna be all right.
Thank you for everything...
...you've done for
this country.
Jarvis.
Have we ever met that guy?
Seems very familiar.
Weird beard, though.
- You're weak.
- I'm you.
You can stop this.
You know you want to.
Did you see what
happens in the future?
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.
You wanna know
how he does that?
You wanna know, what
he does to you?
That's enough.
You disgust me.
But, that doesn't
mean you're useless.
How do I look?
Wow...
Under different circumstances,
this would be totally awesome.
I bet the raccoon didn't
have to climb a mountain.
Technically, he's not
a raccoon, you know.
Whatever. He eats garbage.
Welcome.
Natasha, daughter of Ivan.
Clint, son of Edith.
Who are you?
Consider me a guide.
To you, and to all who
seek the Soul Stone.
Okay. You tell us where it is.
Then we'll be on our way.
If only it were that easy.
What you seek lies
in front of you...
...as does what you fear.
The stone is down there.
For one of you.
For the other...
In order to take the stone, you
must lose that which you love.
An everlasting exchange.
A soul, for a soul.
How's it going?
Jesus...
Maybe he's making this () up.
No. I don't think so.
Why, 'cause he knows
your Daddy's name?
I didn't.
Thanos left here with the stone
without his daughter.
It's not a coincidence.
Yeah.
Whatever it takes.
Whatever it takes.
If we don't get that stone,
billions of people stay dead.
Then I guess we both
know who it's gotta be.
I guess we do.
I'm starting to think, we've been
different people here, Natasha.
For the last five years I've been trying
to do one thing: Get to right here.
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.
- Oh, don't you get all decent on me now.
- What, you think I wanna do it?
I'm trying to save
your life, you idiot.
Yeah well, I don't want
you to, because I...
Natasha, you know
what I've done.
You know what I've become.
I don't judge people on
their worst mistakes.
Maybe you should.
You didn't.
You're a pain in my
ass, you know that?
Okay.
You win.
Tell my family I love them.
You tell them yourself.
() you!
Let me go.
No.
Please, no.
It's okay.
Please...
Did we get them all?
You telling me this'll
actually work?
Clint, where's Nat?
Do we know if she had family?
Yeah. Us.
What?
I just asked him a question...
Yeah, you're acting like she's dead.
Why are we acting like she's dead?
We have the stones, right?
As long as we have
the stones, Cap, we can bring
her back, isn't that right?
So stop this (). We're the
Avengers, get it together.
We can't get her back.
- Wha- what?
- It can't be undone. It can't.
I'm sorry. No offense, but you're
a very earthly being. Okay?
We're talking about space magic.
And "can't" seems very () don't you think?
Look, I know that I'm way
outside my paygrade here.
But she still isn't
here, is she?
- Now that's my point.
- It can't be undone.
Or that's at least what the,
great floating guy had to say.
Maybe you wanna go talk to him?
Okay?
Go grab your hammer, and you
go fly and you talk to him.
It was supposed to be me.
She sacrificed her life for that
() stone. She bet her life on it.
She's not coming back.
We have to make it worth it.
We have to.
We will.
Boom!
All right. The glove's ready.
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freaking fingers?
I'll do it.
It's okay.
- No, no, no, no. Stop. Stop.
- Hey, hey...
Thor, just wait.
We haven't decided who's
gonna put that on yet.
I'm sorry. What, were you just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?
We should at least discuss it.
Look, us sitting here staring at that
thing is not gonna bring everybody back.
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So
this responsibility falls upon me.
It's my duty. It's not that... It's...
stop it! Just let me.
Just let me do it. Just
let me do something good.
- Something great.
- Look...
It's not just the fact that
that glove is channeling
enough energy to light up a
continent, I'm telling you
you're in no condition.
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?
Cheez Whiz?
- Lightning.
- Yeah.
Lightning won't help you, pal.
It's gotta be me.
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.
It almost killed him.
None of you could survive.
How do we know you will?
I don't. But the
radiation's mostly gamma.
It's like...
I was meant for this.
Good to go, yeah?
Let's do it.
You remember everyone
Thanos snapped away five
years ago and just bringing
them back to now, today.
Don't change anything
from the last five years.
Got it.
Friday, do me a favor and
activate protocol 8.
Yes, boss.
Everybody comes home.
- Take it off. Take it off!
- No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?
Talk to me, Banner.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Bruce!
Don't move him.
- Did it work?
- Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.
Honey.
Honey.
Guys...
I think it worked!
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!
I can't breathe.
Canopy. Canopy. Canopy.
Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Come on!
Rhodey!
Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're
in the lower level, it's flooding!
- What?
- We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!
Wait! I'm here! I'm
here, can you hear me?
Cap?
Daughter.
Yes, Father.
So, this is the future.
Well done.
Thank you, Father. They
suspected nothing.
The arrogant never do.
Go.
Find the stones.
Bring them to me.
What will you do?
Wait.
Tell me something.
In the future, what
happens to you and me?
I tried to kill you.
Several times.
But eventually,
we become friends.
We become sisters.
Come on.
We can stop him.
Come on, buddy. Wake up.
That's my man.
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.
What happened?
We messed with time.
It tends to mess back.
You'll see.
What's he been doing?
Absolutely nothing.
Where are the stones?
Lost somewhere under all this.
All I know is he
doesn't have them.
So we keep it that way.
- You know it's a trap, right?
- Yeah...
I don't much care.
Good.
Just as long as we're
all in agreement.
Let's kill him
properly this time.
You could not live
with your own failure.
Where did that bring you?
Back to me.
I thought by eliminating
half of life,
the other half would thrive.
But you've shown me,
that's impossible.
And as long as there are those
that remember what was,
there will always be those that
are unable to accept what can be.
They will resist.
Yep. We're all
kinds of stubborn.
I'm thankful.
Because now, I know
what I must do.
I will shred this universe
down to its last atom.
And then...
With the stones you've collected
for me, create a new one.
Teeming with life,
but knows not what it has lost
but only what it has been given.
A grateful universe.
Born out of blood.
They'll never know it.
Because you won't be
alive to tell them.
See you on the other side, man.
Hang on! I'm coming!
Oh, hey...
I know you.
Father. I have the stones.
What?!
Stop.
You're betraying us?
You don't have to do this.
I am... this.
No, you're not.
You've seen what we become.
Nebula, listen to her.
You can change.
He won't let me.
No!
Okay, Thor. Hit me.
Boss, wake up.
I knew it!
In all my years of conquest...
violence...
slaughter...
It was never personal.
But I'll tell you now...
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,
annoying little planet...
I'm gonna enjoy it.
Very, very much.
Cap, you hear me?
Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?
On your left.
Is that everyone?
What, you wanted more?
Avengers...
... assemble.
No, no. Give me that.
You have the little one.
Hey!
Holy cow.
You will not believe what's been going on.
Do you remember when we were in space?
And I got all dusty? I must've passed
out, 'cause I woke up, and you were gone.
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
He was like,
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us!"
And then he started doing the yellow
sparkly thing that he does all the time...
What are you doing?
This is nice.
Gamora?
I thought I lost you.
Don't... touch... me!
You missed the first time...
then you got them
both the second time.
This is the one? Seriously?
The choices were him, or a tree.
Cap, what do you want me to
do with this () thing?
Get those stones as
far away as possible!
No!
We need to get them back
where they came from.
No way to get them back. Thanos
destroyed the quantum tunnel.
Hold on!
That wasn't our
only time machine.
Anyone see an ugly
brown van up there?
Yes!
But you're not gonna
like where it's parked.
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?
Maybe ten minutes.
Get it started. We'll
get the stones to you.
We're on it, Cap.
Hey.
You said one out of 14
million, we win, yeah?
Tell me this is it.
If I tell you what
happens, it won't happen.
You better be right.
It's a mess back here.
It's... it's dead.
- What?
- It's dead.
I have to hotwire it.
Where's Nebula?
She's not responding.
Sire!
Clint!
Give it to me.
You took everything from me.
I don't even know who you are.
You will.
I got it!
Activate Instant Kill!
Rain fire!
But Sire, our troops!
Just do it!
Is anyone else seeing this?
I got this.
I got this!
Okay, I don't got this.
- Help! Somebody, help!
- Hey, Queens. Heads up.
Hang on. I got you, kid.
Hey! Nice to meet---
Oh! My God!
What the hell is this?
Friday, what are they firing at?
Something just entered
the upper atmosphere.
Oh, yeah!
Danvers, we need an assist here.
Hi. I'm Peter Parker.
Hey, Peter Parker. Got
something for me?
I don't know how you're
gonna get through all that.
Don't worry.
She's got help.
I am... inevitable.
And I...
am...
... Iron Man.
Mr. Stark?
Hey...
Mr. Stark? Can you hear me?
It's Peter.
We won.
Mr. Stark....
We won, Mr. Stark.
We won and you did it, sir.
You did it.
I'm sorry... Tony...
- Hey.
- Hey, Pep...
- Friday?
- Life functions critical.
Tony.
Look at me.
We're gonna be okay.
You can rest now.
Everybody wants a
happy ending, right?
But it doesn't always
roll that way.
Maybe this time.
I'm hoping if you
play this back,
it's in celebration.
I hope families are reunited,
I hope we get it back,
and something like a
normal version of the
planet has been restored.
If there ever was such a thing.
God, what a world.
Universe, now.
If you told me ten years
ago that we weren't alone,
let alone, you know,
to this extent,
I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised.
But come on, you know?
That epic forces of darkness and
light that have come into play.
And, for better or worse,
that's the reality Morgan's gonna
have to find a way to grow up in.
So I found the time and I
recorded a little greeting...
In the case of an untimely death.
On my part.
Not that, death in any
time isn't untimely.
This time travel thing that we're
gonna try and pull off tomorrow,
it's, it's got me scratching
my head about this.
But then again, that's the hero gig.
Part of the journey is the end.
Everything's gonna work out
exactly the way it's supposed to.
I love you 3,000.
You know, I wish
there was a way...
that I could let her know.
That we won.
We did it.
She knows.
They both do.
How you doing, Squirt?
- Good.
- You good?
- Okay. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you want?
- Cheeseburgers.
You know your Dad
liked cheeseburgers?
I'm gonna get you all the
cheeseburgers you want.
Okay.
So, when can we expect you back?
- About that...
- Thor. Your people need a king.
No, they already have one.
That's funny.
You're being serious?
It's time for me to be
who I am rather than
who I'm supposed to be.
But you, you're a leader.
That's who you are.
You know I'd make a lot
of changes around here.
I'm counting on it.
Your Majesty.
What will you do?
I'm not sure.
For the first time in a
thousand years, I...
I have no path. I do
have a ride, though.
Move it or lose it, hairbag.
Well, here we are.
Tree! Good to see you.
Well...
The As-Guardians of the
Galaxy back together again.
Where to first?
Just so you know, this is my ship still.
I'm in charge.
I know. I know. Of
course, you are.
Of course.
See, you say of course, but
then you touch the map.
It makes you think that maybe you
didn't realize I was in charge.
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there. Okay?
I'm merely trying to be of service.
An assistant.
- Quill.
- That's what I said.
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.
Sounds fair.
- It's not necessary.
- It's not.
Okay?
I got some blasters unless
you guys wanna use knives.
Oh, yes. Please, use knives.
I am Groot.
Not necessary.
There shall be no
knifing one another.
Everybody knows who's in charge.
It's me.
Yes, you! Of course!
Of course. Of course.
Remember...
You have to return the stones at
the exact moment you got them.
Or you're gonna open up a bunch
of nasty alternative realities.
Don't worry, Bruce.
Clip all the branches.
You know, I tried.
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,
I really tried to bring her back.
- I miss them, man.
- Me, too.
You know, if you want,
I can come with you.
You're a good man, Sam.
This one's on me, though.
Don't do anything stupid
'till I get back.
How can I? You're taking
all the stupid with you.
Gonna miss you, Buddy.
It's gonna be okay, Buck.
How long is this gonna take?
For him? As long as he
needs, For us, five seconds.
Ready, Cap?
Alright. We'll meet
you back here, okay?
You bet.
Going quantum. Three..
two.. one...
And returning in, five,
four, three, two, one...
Where is he?
I don't know. He blew right by his
time stamp. He should be here.
- Well, get him back.
- I'm trying.
- Get him the () back.
- I said, I'm trying!
Sam.
Go ahead.
Cap?
Hi, Sam.
So did something go wrong,
or did something go right?
Well, after I put the
stones back, I thought...
Maybe I'll try some
of that life Tony was...
telling me to get.
How did that work out for you?
It was beautiful.
I'm happy for you. Truly.
Thank you.
Only thing bumming me
out is the fact I have
to live in a world
without Captain America.
Oh...
That reminds me...
Try it on.
How's it feel?
Like it's someone else's.
It isn't.
Thank you.
I'll do my best.
That's why it's yours.
You wanna tell me about her?
No.
No, I don't think I will.

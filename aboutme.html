<h1><center>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born on August 8, 2004 in San Diego, CA. My family and I lived in Chula Vista, CA from 2003-2006. In 2006, we moved to Jacksonville, FL. I went to Pre-K in Jacksonville at the Goddard School in 2008, amd in 2009, we moved to Jamaica Estates in New York City. In New York, I went to the Immaculate Conception School in Kindergarten and the United Nations International School for 1st grade. In 2011, we moved to Portsmouth, RI, a few miles north of Newport.I went to the All Saints Academy for 3 years, and then in 2014, we moved to the town of Smithtown, NY, about 40 miles east of New York City. I went to RJO Intermediate School and WTR Middle School, and in 2017, I moved to San Diego, CA. I went to Bernardo Heights Middle School and then Rancho Bernardo High School. In 2022, when I graduate, I plan on pursuing a career in the military, computer science or a surgeon or doctor.</p>

<p> Some of my favorite things include playing video games and sports. I am an Xbox gamer and I like to play basketball in my driveway or throw around a football with my friends or family. My family and I travel often (at least one or two cross country trips a year usually) to cities like New York and Orlando.  Some of my favorite foods include meats such as beef and pork and potatoes, either mashed, baked or as french fries. My favorite season is summer, because there's no school and the weather's nice.

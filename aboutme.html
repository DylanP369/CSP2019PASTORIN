<h1><center>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in San Diego, CA on August 8, 2004. My family was living in Chula Vista at the time and my mom and dad were at Fashion Valley Mall right before I was born. My family lived in Chula Vista from 2003-2006. In 2006, due to my dad's job in the military (he's a helicopter pilot in the US Navy) we moved to Jacksonville, FL. I went to preschool there in 2008, and then in 2009, we moved to Queens, NY in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood. My dad was deployed at times between 1998 and 2009, but after 2009, my dad did not have to be deployed anymore, but remained in the Navy. Between 2009 and 2011, I went to Pre-K, Kindergarten and 1st Grade at the Immaculate Conception School and the United Nations International School. During that period, my dad got his master's degree at the Naval War College. When he got his degree in 2011, my dad was stationed in Newport and my family moved there. My dad was promoted to the rank of Commander in 2013 and then in 2014, after my 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade years at the All Saints Academy, we moved to Smithtown, NY, and my dad was placed in charge of a Naval Reserve Center in the nearby town of Farmingdale, NY. After my 5th, 6th and 7th grade years at RJO Intermediate School and WTR Middle School, my dad was transferred back to San Diego, CA to return to flying helicopters in 2017. In 2019, my dad was promoted to the rank of Captain and was transferred to take command of another Naval Reserve Center in Los Angeles, CA. However, we did not move, and I remained a student at Rancho Bernardo High School. My dad also stayed with us in San Diego and would make the drive to LA every work morning. After 2022, when I graduate, I plan to pursue a career either in computer science or in the military.</p>

<p> Some of my favorite things include playing video games and sports. I am an Xbox gamer and I like to play basketball in my driveway or throw around a football with my friends or family. My family and I travel often (at least two or three cross country trips a year usually) to cities like New York and Orlando. I have no siblings, and I am an only child. Some of my favorite foods include meats such as beef and pork and potatoes, either mashed, baked or as french fries. My favorite season is summer, because there's no school and the weather's nice.
